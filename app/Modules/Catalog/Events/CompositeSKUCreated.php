/**
 * `CompositeSKUCreated` — recorded when a Composite SKU is created in `draft` with its ordered constituent
 * Product References (catalog-product-spine, design D7/D8/D9; product-catalog — Requirement: Spine Creation
 * Events). The verbatim §14.1 event name — note the §14.1 spelling keeps `SKU` upper-case (the inter-module
 * contract key recorded in `domain_events.name`), while the canonical model class is `CompositeSku` (the §18
 * naming cascade, design D7); `*Created` carries the `<null> → draft` semantics of §14.2.
 *
 * One of the seven one-class-per-event classes under the module's `Events/` surface — the Catalog slice of the
 * ~120-event inter-module API (CLAUDE.md: events + contracts are the only cross-module coupling). The class is
 * the single source of truth for an event's three contract facets, so the `CreateCompositeSku` action stays
 * thin and free of magic strings (the event names no caller — the dependency runs action → event, never back):
 *   - {@see NAME} — the canonical event name passed to the DomainEventRecorder;
 *   - {@see ENTITY_TYPE} — the envelope `entity_type` for a Composite SKU;
 *   - {@see payload()} — the PII-free creation payload (ids only).
 *
 * No `*Activated`/`*Retired` sibling exists in this change (design D3 scope guard).
