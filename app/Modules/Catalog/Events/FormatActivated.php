 * `FormatActivated` — recorded when a Format transitions `reviewed → active` (catalog-lifecycle-approval,
 * design D9; product-catalog — Requirement: Product Lifecycle Events). The verbatim §14.1 event name
 * (category-neutral per §18); §14.2 binds it to the `reviewed → active` step ONLY — the `draft → reviewed`
 * checkpoint and the `retired → reviewed` reopen are audit-only (no domain event), and there is no
 * `*Reviewed` event anywhere in the catalog surface.
 *
 * One of the fourteen `*Activated`/`*Retired` lifecycle events this change adds — the Catalog slice of the
 * ~120-event inter-module API (CLAUDE.md: events + contracts are the only cross-module coupling). It is
 * recorded by the shared `LifecycleTransition` mechanism (via the `ActivateFormat` action, task 4.1) inside
 * the SAME transaction as the `lifecycle_state` write (§14.1 / invariant 4 — the transactional outbox). The
 * class is the single source of truth for the event's three contract facets, so the action stays thin and
 * free of magic strings (the event names no caller — the dependency runs action → event, never back):
 *   - {@see NAME} — the canonical event name passed to the DomainEventRecorder;
 *   - {@see ENTITY_TYPE} — the envelope `entity_type` for a Format;
 *   - {@see payload()} — the PII-free transition payload (entity id + lifecycle value only).
