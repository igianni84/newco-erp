## Requirements
### Requirement: Party-Type Marker on Subtype

Every Party-subtype entity SHALL carry a **party-type marker** whose domain is exactly `customer`, `supplier`, `third_party_owner`, set at creation and **immutable thereafter** — a Customer SHALL NOT become a Supplier or vice versa. At launch this marker SHALL be represented as an immutable attribute on each distinct subtype entity (Customer carries `customer`, Supplier carries `supplier`), NOT a shared Party-registry row; the unified Party Registry table, the dormant `third_party_owner` subtype entity, and any cross-marker overlap SHALL be deferred and SHALL NOT be modelled in this change. The **Producer** entity SHALL NOT be a Party subtype and SHALL NOT carry a party-type marker.

#### Scenario: The marker is set at creation and is immutable

- **WHEN** a Customer is created
- **THEN** it carries the party-type marker `customer`, and there is no operation in this change that changes a created entity's party-type marker
- **WHEN** a Supplier is created
- **THEN** it carries the party-type marker `supplier`

#### Scenario: A Customer and a Supplier are distinct typed entities

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** Customer and Supplier are distinct `parties_*` entities each fixing its own marker, so a Customer can never become a Supplier; no shared `parties_parties` registry table and no `third_party_owner` entity exist in this change

#### Scenario: Producer is not a Party

- **WHEN** the Producer entity is inspected
- **THEN** it carries no party-type marker and is a standalone registry, not a Party subtype

### Requirement: Producer Registry

The Producer SHALL be the winery identity registry — the source of the producer reference that Module 0's Product Master keys off — and SHALL be a **standalone** entity, not a Party subtype. A Producer SHALL be created in the `draft` state, SHALL carry its identity attributes (name, region, optional appellation, country) and a translatable customer-facing description held as i18n-keyed text with per-attribute English fallback, and SHALL record a `ProducerCreated` domain event on creation. Creating a Producer SHALL NOT auto-create a Supplier (and the converse SHALL also hold): the two registries are linked only by an explicit operator action that lives in Module D, never implicitly here.

#### Scenario: Create a Producer

- **WHEN** an operator creates a Producer with a name, region and country
- **THEN** it is persisted in `draft`, its description is held as translatable text resolvable with an English fallback, and a `ProducerCreated` event is recorded

#### Scenario: Creating a Producer does not auto-create a Supplier

- **WHEN** a Producer is created
- **THEN** no Supplier row is created as a side effect; the two remain independent registries

### Requirement: Supplier — Minimal Party Subtype

The Supplier SHALL be the commercial-counterpart entity and SHALL be a Party subtype carrying the immutable party-type marker `supplier`. At launch the Supplier SHALL be **deliberately minimal** — a legal name, the immutable party-type marker, and standard timestamps — with richer Supplier-side commercial state (Supplier Profile, payment terms, the Supplier↔Producer link) owned by Module D and **not** modelled here. Creating a Supplier SHALL NOT auto-create a Producer. The product-catalog event pattern notwithstanding, Supplier creation SHALL record **no** domain event, because the PRD event catalog names none.

#### Scenario: Create a minimal Supplier

- **WHEN** an operator creates a Supplier with a legal name
- **THEN** it is persisted carrying the immutable party-type marker `supplier` and standard timestamps, and carries no commercial-terms or Supplier↔Producer-link attributes (those are Module D's)

#### Scenario: Supplier creation records no event

- **WHEN** a Supplier is created
- **THEN** no `SupplierCreated` (or any Supplier) domain event is recorded — the PRD names none

_Source: spec/02-prd/Module_K_PRD_v0.3-MVP.md § 4.5 (Supplier — minimal Party subtype: legal name + immutable party-type marker + timestamps; richer state in Module D; no auto-link) · § 14.1 BR-K-Identity-5 (immutable marker) · § 14.5 BR-K-Producer-3 (no auto-cross-create) · § 15 (no Supplier event family) · spec/04-decisions/decisions.md DEC-067 / DEC-084 (Supplier terms live on the Allocation, not Module K) · spec/03-acceptance/Module_K_Acceptance_v0.3-MVP.md § 4 AC-K-BR-Identity-5, AC-K-BR-Producer-3._

### Requirement: Club

A Club SHALL be a Producer-operated membership program associated with **exactly one** operating Producer; Club creation SHALL be rejected when the operating-Producer association is missing, and the operating-Producer link SHALL be **immutable** once set (it does not change with Club lifecycle state). A Club SHALL be created in the `active` state and SHALL carry its per-Club fee as an **integer count of minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code** (never a float), a registration-flow type, and the single-tier-at-launch structure. A Club SHALL record a `ClubCreated` domain event on creation.

#### Scenario: Create a Club for a Producer

- **WHEN** an operator creates a Club naming an existing operating Producer, with a fee amount and currency
- **THEN** it is persisted in `active`, the fee is stored as integer minor units + an ISO 4217 currency code, the operating-Producer reference is captured, and a `ClubCreated` event is recorded

#### Scenario: Club creation rejects a missing Producer

- **WHEN** a Club is created with no operating-Producer association
- **THEN** the creation is rejected

#### Scenario: The operating-Producer link is immutable

- **WHEN** the Club entity is inspected
- **THEN** there is no operation in this change that reassigns a Club's operating Producer

_Source: spec/02-prd/Module_K_PRD_v0.3-MVP.md § 4.3 (Club — one operating Producer, immutable; born `active`; fee model; registration-flow type; single-tier launch) · § 14.4 BR-K-Club-1/2/5 (Producer required; link immutable; single tier) · § 15.3 (`ClubCreated`) · spec/04-decisions/decisions.md DEC-062 (single-tier at launch; multi-tier structure carried) · CLAUDE.md invariant 6 (money = integer minor units + ISO 4217) · openspec/specs/money/spec.md · spec/03-acceptance/Module_K_Acceptance_v0.3-MVP.md § 3 AC-K-FSM-6, § 4 AC-K-BR-Club-1, § 5 AC-K-EVT-7._

### Requirement: ProducerAgreement

The ProducerAgreement SHALL be the commercial agreement between NewCo and a Producer — a NewCo net-new entity. It SHALL reference **exactly one** Producer (required) and MAY be narrowed to a specific Club (optional); it SHALL be created in the `draft` state, SHALL carry its term dates and a settlement-cadence attribute (the D19 seam Module E reads), and SHALL record a `ProducerAgreementCreated` domain event on creation. The "at most one **active** agreement per Producer scope" rule is an **activation-time** invariant and is therefore out of this creation-only slice; draft agreements MAY be created freely.

#### Scenario: Create a draft ProducerAgreement

- **WHEN** an operator creates a ProducerAgreement naming a Producer, optionally narrowed to one of that Producer's Clubs
- **THEN** it is persisted in `draft` with its term dates and settlement cadence, and a `ProducerAgreementCreated` event is recorded

#### Scenario: A ProducerAgreement requires a Producer

- **WHEN** a ProducerAgreement is created with no Producer reference
- **THEN** the creation is rejected

_Source: spec/02-prd/Module_K_PRD_v0.3-MVP.md § 4.6 / § 4.6.1 (ProducerAgreement — Producer required, Club optional; born `draft`; settlement-cadence D19 seam; lifecycle `draft → active → superseded|terminated`) · § 14.6 BR-K-Agreement-1 (one active per scope — an activation rule) · § 15.5 (`ProducerAgreementCreated`) · spec/04-decisions/decisions.md DEC-070 (ProducerAgreement entity in Module K) · spec/03-acceptance/Module_K_Acceptance_v0.3-MVP.md § 3 AC-K-FSM-8, § 4 AC-K-BR-Agreement-1, § 5 AC-K-EVT-9._

### Requirement: Customer Identity

The Customer SHALL be NewCo's **natural-person** registry (B2C only; the record carries no B2C/B2B discriminator). A Customer's email SHALL be **globally unique** across all Customers, and a creation whose email collides with an existing Customer SHALL be rejected. A Customer SHALL be created in the `pending` state, SHALL carry the immutable party-type marker `customer`, a preferred currency (an ISO 4217 code from the launch set) and a preferred locale (from the launch set). A Customer SHALL carry an `originating_club_id` reference into the Club registry that is **created `NULL`** and is **set one-shot at the Customer's first-ever Profile approval** (per the *Profile Membership Approval* requirement) — **immutable thereafter** (no admin-override surface at launch) and permitted to **remain `NULL` indefinitely** for a Customer never approved into any Club (DEC-040). A Customer SHALL record a `CustomerCreated` domain event on creation whose payload is **PII-free** (no name, email, phone or date of birth).

#### Scenario: Create a Customer

- **WHEN** an operator creates a Customer with a unique email, a preferred currency and a preferred locale
- **THEN** it is persisted in `pending`, carrying the immutable party-type marker `customer` and an `originating_club_id` of `NULL`, and a `CustomerCreated` event is recorded with a payload that contains no name, email, phone or date of birth

#### Scenario: Duplicate email is rejected

- **WHEN** a Customer is created with an email that matches an existing Customer
- **THEN** the creation is rejected; two distinct emails both succeed

#### Scenario: The Originating Club is born unset and locked one-shot at first approval

- **WHEN** a newly created Customer is inspected
- **THEN** its `originating_club_id` is `NULL`
- **WHEN** that Customer's first-ever Profile is approved (per *Profile Membership Approval*)
- **THEN** `originating_club_id` is set one-shot to the approving Club and is immutable thereafter; a Customer never approved into any Club keeps it `NULL`

### Requirement: Account — Billing Container

The Account SHALL be the per-Customer transactional/billing container, distinct from the Customer (the natural-person identity). It SHALL be **co-provisioned** within the same transaction as the Customer (one Customer = one Account at launch), SHALL be created in the `active` state with account type `personal`, and SHALL carry a default currency. The Account SHALL **NOT** be a monetary-balance or credit ledger — there is no "Account Credit" instrument at NewCo (goodwill is vouchers; Club Credits live on the Profile). The payment-provider customer reference SHALL **NOT** be provisioned at Account creation (it is created lazily on first payment-related action — out of this slice). Account creation SHALL record **no** domain event, because the PRD event catalog names none.

#### Scenario: Customer creation provisions one Account

- **WHEN** a Customer is created
- **THEN** exactly one Account is provisioned for that Customer in the same transaction, in `active` state with type `personal` and a default currency

#### Scenario: The Account holds no monetary balance and emits no event

- **WHEN** the Account entity is inspected
- **THEN** it carries no monetary-balance / credit-ledger attribute and no payment-provider reference at creation, and no `AccountCreated` (or any Account) domain event was recorded

_Source: spec/02-prd/Module_K_PRD_v0.3-MVP.md § 4.7 (Account — billing container; co-provisioned; born `active`/`personal`; NOT a money ledger; payment-provider ref lazy) · § 7.1 step 3 (Customer + Account + Party created together in onboarding) · § 15 (no Account event family) · spec/04-decisions/decisions.md DEC-014 (payment-provider reference only; no PCI) · DEC-068 (personal account at launch) · spec/03-acceptance/Module_K_Acceptance_v0.3-MVP.md § 2 AC-K-J-1, § 3 AC-K-FSM-9, § 4 AC-K-XM-22._

### Requirement: Profile — Multi-Profile Membership

The Profile SHALL **be** the membership in one Club — there SHALL be no separate Membership entity (the Netflix-style Customer↔Profile model). A Profile SHALL belong to **exactly one** Customer and **exactly one** Club, both required at creation. A single Customer MAY hold **multiple** Profiles across different Clubs, but SHALL hold **at most one non-terminal Profile per Club** (uniqueness on the Customer–Club pair), so a second Profile for a (Customer, Club) pair that already has a live Profile SHALL be rejected. A Profile SHALL be created in the `Applied` state and SHALL record a `ProfileCreated` domain event on creation. _(Because rejected, cancelled and inactive Profiles are not reused — a re-application creates a new Profile row — the Customer–Club uniqueness is scoped to non-terminal states. With this change the terminal states `rejected`/`cancelled`/`inactive` are **all reachable** — `rejected` via `DeclineProfile`, and `cancelled`/`inactive` via the *Profile Cancellation and Deactivation* requirement — and the partial-unique index `(customer_id, club_id) WHERE state NOT IN ('rejected','cancelled','inactive')` already excludes all three, so a terminal Profile never blocks a fresh `Applied` Profile for the same pair, with no index migration. `suspended` and `lapsed` are **non-terminal** and so still block a second live Profile.)_

#### Scenario: Create a Profile

- **WHEN** an operator creates a Profile for a Customer in a Club
- **THEN** it is persisted in `Applied`, referencing exactly one Customer and one Club, and a `ProfileCreated` event is recorded

#### Scenario: One non-terminal Profile per Customer–Club pair

- **WHEN** a second Profile is created for a (Customer, Club) pair that already has a live Profile
- **THEN** the creation is rejected

#### Scenario: A Customer may hold Profiles across many Clubs

- **WHEN** a Customer is given Profiles in three different Clubs
- **THEN** all three are created (the multi-profile model), each unique on its own Customer–Club pair

#### Scenario: A terminal Profile does not block a fresh application

- **GIVEN** a Customer whose Profile for Club C is in a terminal state (`cancelled` or `inactive`)
- **WHEN** a new Profile is created for the same Customer–Club pair
- **THEN** the new Profile is created in `Applied` (the partial-unique index excludes the terminal states), while a `suspended` or `lapsed` (non-terminal) Profile for the pair would still block it

### Requirement: Birth States Recorded, Lifecycle Transitions Deferred

Every Parties entity that carries a lifecycle state SHALL define its full state domain and SHALL be created in its birth state: Customer `pending`, Account `active`, Producer `draft`, Club `active`, ProducerAgreement `draft`, Profile `Applied` (Supplier carries no lifecycle state). The **supply-side** lifecycle — Producer, ProducerAgreement and Club — SHALL implement its state transitions and emit its lifecycle events, as governed by the Requirements *Producer Lifecycle*, *ProducerAgreement Lifecycle*, *Club Lifecycle* and *Supply-Side Lifecycle Events*. The **Customer and Producer compliance-screening lifecycles** — the KYC FSM and the Customer sanctions FSM, **each separate from the Customer/Producer status FSM** — SHALL be implemented as governed by the Requirements *Customer KYC Lifecycle*, *Customer Sanctions Screening Lifecycle*, *Producer KYC Lifecycle* and *Sanctions Screening Events*; their fields are added additively (nullable — DEC-071). The **demand-side** status lifecycle is now **fully implemented** across activation and suspension. Activation (the Requirements *Customer Onboarding Activation*, *Profile Membership Approval*, *Profile Activation* and *Demand-Side Activation Events*): Customer `pending → active`, Profile `Applied → Approved | Rejected` and `Approved → Active`, and the Originating-Club one-shot lock — emitting `CustomerActivated` / `ProfileActivated` / `OriginatingClubLocked` (approval and decline audit-only — § 15.2 names no `ProfileApproved` / `ProfileRejected`). Suspension and the remaining status edges (the Requirements *Profile Suspension and Restoration*, *Profile Lapse and Grace Renewal*, *Profile Cancellation and Deactivation*, *Customer Suspension and Closure*, *Account Status Lifecycle*, *Hold-Driven Status Coupling* and *Demand-Side Status Events*): Profile `Active → Suspended | Lapsed | Cancelled | Inactive` and `Lapsed → Active` grace, Customer `active → suspended | closed` (suspension cascading to the Customer's Profiles), and Account `active → suspended → closed` — emitting `CustomerSuspended` / `CustomerReactivated` / `CustomerClosed` and `ProfileSuspended` / `ProfileReactivated` / `ProfileExpired` / `ProfileRenewed` / `ProfileInactive` (Account transitions and Profile cancellation are **audit-only** — § 15 names no Account event and the § 15.2 family names no `ProfileCancelled`). The **Hold→`suspended` status coupling** is now implemented (the *Hold-Driven Status Coupling* requirement): placing a Hold drives every covered scope in its suspendable from-state to `suspended`, and lifting a Hold restores a covered scope **iff no other active Hold** still covers it (ADR 2026-06-19); the unified Hold registry and the `kyc` Hold compliance coupling (auto-place on KYC `pending`, auto-lift on `verified`) remain as governed by the Requirements *Hold Registry*, *Hold Lifecycle and Lift Discipline*, *Hold Events* and *Hold and Sanctions Read-API*. The **Club Credit** instrument is now implemented as a Module K entity (the Requirements *Club Credit Entity and One-Active-Per-Profile Invariant*, *Club Credit Issuance*, *Club Credit Redemption and Carry-Forward*, *Club Credit Forfeiture and Restoration* and *Club Credit State Recording Is Module-E-Owned*): a per-Profile prepayment instrument created `active` on issuance, with the FSM `active → redeemed | forfeited` driven by the within-module writers `IssueClubCredit` / `ApplyClubCredit` (K.17 carry-forward) / `ForfeitClubCredit` / `RestoreClubCredit`, the structural one-active-per-Profile invariant, and the freeze-while-suspended guarantee (the deferred `club-credit` seam the suspension slice named, now closed). These writers are **audit-only** — § 11.4 makes the `ClubCreditIssued` / `ClubCreditApplied` / `ClubCreditRestored` / `ClubCreditForfeited` lifecycle events (and the `MembershipFeePaid` trigger) **Module E's**, so Module K records state and emits no Club Credit event. The Club Credit **cross-module triggers** remain deferred seams: the Module-E `MembershipFeePaid` listener + `ClubCredit*` consumers (Phase 6), the Module-S checkout redemption and the Club-closure → Discovery store-credit conversion (DEC-043), the year-end-lapse scheduler, and the Profile-cancellation → forfeit cascade. Only three demand-side **status** seams SHALL remain deferred: the **Hero Package Capacity Invariant** (approval and activation ship **uncapped** — the Module-A seam), the `Applied → WaitingList` path (and its `WaitingListJoined` event), and **Customer-segment derivation** (and its `CustomerSegmentChanged` event) — until the follow-on changes (`parties-hero-package`, `parties-customer-segments`) implement them. `ActivateAccount` SHALL NOT exist (the Account is born `active`; its only `→ active` edge is the restore `ReactivateAccount`).

#### Scenario: Each entity is born in its birth state

- **WHEN** a Customer, Account, Producer, Club, ProducerAgreement or Profile is created
- **THEN** its state is, respectively, `pending`, `active`, `draft`, `active`, `draft`, `Applied`

#### Scenario: The demand-side status transitions and the Hold coupling exist; only the capacity, WaitingList and segment seams remain

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** Producer, ProducerAgreement and Club expose lifecycle-transition operations and record their lifecycle events; the Customer/Producer KYC and Customer sanctions screening FSMs expose their transitions; the unified Hold registry exposes place/lift with the `kyc` Hold auto-placed on KYC `pending` and auto-lifted on `verified`; the demand-side **activation** transitions exist (Customer `pending → active` via `ActivateCustomer`, Profile `Applied → Approved | Rejected` via `ApproveProfile` / `DeclineProfile` and `Approved → Active` via `ActivateProfile`, with the Originating-Club one-shot lock); AND the demand-side **status** transitions exist — Profile `Active → Suspended | Lapsed | Cancelled | Inactive` and `Lapsed → Active` grace, Customer `active → suspended | closed` (cascading to Profiles), Account `active → suspended → closed` — recording `CustomerSuspended` / `CustomerReactivated` / `CustomerClosed` / `ProfileSuspended` / `ProfileReactivated` / `ProfileExpired` / `ProfileRenewed` / `ProfileInactive` (Account transitions and Profile cancellation audit-only)
- **AND** placing a Hold drives the covered scope (in its suspendable from-state) to `suspended` and lifting the last covering Hold restores it
- **AND** the Hero Package Capacity Invariant (approval and activation stay uncapped), the `Applied → WaitingList` path, and Customer-segment derivation do **not** exist; no `WaitingListJoined` / `CustomerSegmentChanged` event is recordable; and no `ActivateAccount` Action exists

#### Scenario: The Club Credit entity and its within-module FSM exist, audit-only

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** the Club Credit entity exists with the writers `IssueClubCredit` / `ApplyClubCredit` / `ForfeitClubCredit` / `RestoreClubCredit` driving `active → redeemed | forfeited` under the one-active-per-Profile invariant, redemption frozen while the Profile is suspended
- **AND** Module K records Club Credit state with **no** `ClubCredit*` domain event of its own and **no** fabricated `MembershipFeePaid` / `ClubCredit*` event class (the § 11.4 ownership boundary)
- **AND** the Club Credit cross-module triggers — the Module-E `MembershipFeePaid` listener and `ClubCredit*` consumers, the Module-S checkout redemption and DEC-043 closure conversion, the year-end scheduler, and the Profile-cancellation cascade — do **not** exist (deferred seams)

### Requirement: Spine Creation Events

On the creation of a Customer, Profile, Producer, Club or ProducerAgreement, the Parties module SHALL record the entity's verbatim `*Created` domain event — `CustomerCreated`, `ProfileCreated`, `ProducerCreated`, `ClubCreated`, `ProducerAgreementCreated` — through the platform `DomainEventRecorder`, **within the same database transaction** as the write, tagged with module `parties`, the acting `actor_role` resolved from the `ActorContext` seam, the entity type and id, and a **PII-free** payload: other parties referenced **by id only**, monetary amounts as integer `minor_units` + ISO 4217 `currency`, and **never** personal data (name, email, phone, date of birth, address). Supplier and Account creation SHALL record **no** domain event (the PRD event catalog names none). No `*Activated`/lifecycle event SHALL be recorded by this change.

#### Scenario: Creating a Customer records a PII-free CustomerCreated

- **WHEN** a Customer is created
- **THEN** a `CustomerCreated` event is recorded in the same transaction, tagged module `parties`, with the customer's entity type and id and a payload that references parties only by id and contains no name, email, phone or date of birth

#### Scenario: Each evented entity records its Created event

- **WHEN** a Profile, Producer, Club or ProducerAgreement is created
- **THEN** the corresponding `*Created` event (`ProfileCreated`, `ProducerCreated`, `ClubCreated`, `ProducerAgreementCreated`) is recorded in the writing transaction with a PII-free payload (money as `minor_units` + `currency` where present)

#### Scenario: Supplier and Account creation are event-silent

- **WHEN** a Supplier or an Account is created
- **THEN** no domain event is recorded for that creation

### Requirement: Producer Lifecycle

The Producer SHALL transition through its state machine `draft → active → retired` (one operating direction; the FSM is linear) via explicit operator Actions that are the sole writers of `Producer.status`, each recording its lifecycle event in the same database transaction as the state write.

A Producer in `draft` SHALL transition to `active` on an `ActivateProducer` operation, recording **`ProducerActivated`**. Activation SHALL enforce the **KYC-cleared gate** (§ 4.4; BR-K-Producer-2): the Producer's `kyc_status` SHALL be **cleared** — `verified`, `not_required`, **or NULL** (a Producer never touched by KYC) — and the activation SHALL be **rejected** while `kyc_status` is `pending` or `rejected`, leaving the Producer in `draft` and recording no event. NULL is treated as cleared so the additive KYC field (DEC-071) does not break the activation of Producers created before this change; an operator may explicitly set `not_required` to **waive** KYC (ADR `2026-06-17-producer-kyc-gate-not-required-clears.md`). This closes the deferred seam the previously-shipped slice left ungated; `ProducerActivated` therefore fires on `draft → active` only when KYC is cleared (§ 15.4).

A Producer in `active` SHALL transition to `retired` on a `RetireProducer` operation, recording **`ProducerRetired`**, and SHALL **cascade**: every Club the Producer operates that is currently in `active` SHALL transition to `sunset` (recording its own `ClubSunset`, per the Club Lifecycle requirement) within the same transaction. Clubs already in `sunset` or `closed` SHALL be left unchanged (the cascade is idempotent over already-transitioned Clubs). The **Profile leg** of the § 10.2 offboarding cascade (per-Profile cancellation and the Module-S Club-Credit conversion signal) SHALL NOT be performed by this change — it is deferred with Profile lifecycle.

Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded**: an `ActivateProducer` on a Producer not in `draft`, or a `RetireProducer` on a Producer not in `active`, SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalProducerTransition` and SHALL leave all state and the event log unchanged. The guard SHALL be evaluated against a transaction-locked re-read of the row so concurrent transition attempts cannot both succeed.

#### Scenario: Activate a draft Producer

- **WHEN** `ActivateProducer` is invoked on a Producer in `draft` whose `kyc_status` is cleared (`verified`, `not_required`, or NULL)
- **THEN** the Producer's status becomes `active` and a `ProducerActivated` event is recorded in the same transaction (module `parties`, entityType `Producer`, PII-free payload)

#### Scenario: Activation requires KYC cleared

- **WHEN** `ActivateProducer` is invoked on a `draft` Producer whose `kyc_status` is `verified`, `not_required`, or NULL
- **THEN** the activation succeeds and `ProducerActivated` is recorded
- **WHEN** `ActivateProducer` is invoked on a `draft` Producer whose `kyc_status` is `pending` or `rejected`
- **THEN** the activation is rejected, the Producer stays `draft`, and no `ProducerActivated` event is recorded

#### Scenario: Retire an active Producer cascades Club sunset

- **GIVEN** a Producer in `active` that operates two Clubs in `active` and one Club already in `closed`
- **WHEN** `RetireProducer` is invoked
- **THEN** the Producer's status becomes `retired` and a `ProducerRetired` event is recorded
- **AND** the two `active` Clubs transition to `sunset`, each recording a `ClubSunset` caused by the retirement, while the `closed` Club is left unchanged

#### Scenario: Illegal Producer transitions are rejected

- **WHEN** `ActivateProducer` is invoked on a Producer not in `draft`, or `RetireProducer` on a Producer not in `active`
- **THEN** an `IllegalProducerTransition` is raised, the Producer's status is unchanged, and no `ProducerActivated` / `ProducerRetired` (and no cascade `ClubSunset`) event is recorded

### Requirement: ProducerAgreement Lifecycle

The ProducerAgreement SHALL transition through its state machine `draft → active → superseded | terminated` via explicit operator Actions that are the sole writers of `ProducerAgreement.status`, each recording its lifecycle event in the same database transaction as the state write.

A ProducerAgreement in `draft` SHALL transition to `active` on an `ActivateProducerAgreement` operation, recording **`ProducerAgreementActivated`**. Activation SHALL enforce **BR-K-Agreement-1** (at most one `active` agreement per scope): the **scope** is the `(producer_id, club_id)` tuple, where a `NULL` `club_id` denotes the distinct Producer-wide scope (a Producer-wide agreement and a Club-narrowed agreement therefore occupy different scopes and MAY both be `active`). If an `active` agreement already exists in the same scope as the agreement being activated, that prior agreement SHALL transition `active → superseded` in the same transaction, recording **`ProducerAgreementSuperseded`**, and the audit SHALL pair the two (the superseded agreement references the superseding one, and vice versa, in the event payloads).

A ProducerAgreement in `active` SHALL transition to `terminated` on a `TerminateProducerAgreement` operation, recording **`ProducerAgreementTerminated`**. Termination SHALL NOT cascade to any Producer-level state change (§ 4.6.1).

Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded** against a transaction-locked re-read: an `ActivateProducerAgreement` on an agreement not in `draft`, or a `TerminateProducerAgreement` on an agreement not in `active`, SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalProducerAgreementTransition` and SHALL leave all state and the event log unchanged. The same-scope prior-active lookup SHALL be NULL-safe (a Producer-wide activation matches only other `NULL`-`club_id` agreements of that Producer).

#### Scenario: Activate a draft agreement with no prior active in scope

- **WHEN** `ActivateProducerAgreement` is invoked on a `draft` agreement and no `active` agreement exists in its `(producer_id, club_id)` scope
- **THEN** the agreement's status becomes `active`, a `ProducerAgreementActivated` event is recorded, and no `ProducerAgreementSuperseded` event is recorded

#### Scenario: Activating a replacement supersedes the prior active in the same scope

- **GIVEN** an `active` ProducerAgreement A for a Producer (Producer-wide, `club_id` NULL)
- **WHEN** a second `draft` agreement B for the same Producer (also `club_id` NULL) is activated
- **THEN** A transitions to `superseded` recording `ProducerAgreementSuperseded`, B transitions to `active` recording `ProducerAgreementActivated`, and the two events pair old + new in their payloads

#### Scenario: Scope isolation between Producer-wide and Club-narrowed agreements

- **GIVEN** an `active` Producer-wide agreement (`club_id` NULL) and an `active` Club-narrowed agreement (`club_id = C`) for the same Producer
- **WHEN** a new `draft` Club-narrowed agreement for the same `club_id = C` is activated
- **THEN** only the prior `club_id = C` agreement is superseded; the Producer-wide agreement remains `active`

#### Scenario: Terminate an active agreement without cascading

- **WHEN** `TerminateProducerAgreement` is invoked on an `active` agreement
- **THEN** the agreement's status becomes `terminated`, a `ProducerAgreementTerminated` event is recorded, and the Producer's state is unchanged

#### Scenario: Illegal ProducerAgreement transitions are rejected

- **WHEN** `ActivateProducerAgreement` is invoked on an agreement not in `draft`, or `TerminateProducerAgreement` on an agreement not in `active`
- **THEN** an `IllegalProducerAgreementTransition` is raised, no status changes, and no agreement lifecycle event is recorded

### Requirement: Club Lifecycle

The Club SHALL transition through its state machine `active → sunset → closed` via explicit operator Actions that are the sole writers of `Club.status`, each recording its lifecycle event in the same database transaction as the state write.

A Club in `active` SHALL transition to `sunset` on a `SunsetClub` operation, recording **`ClubSunset`**. `SunsetClub` SHALL be the single writer of `ClubSunset` — invoked both as a standalone operator action and as the per-Club step of the Producer-retirement cascade (Producer Lifecycle requirement). Sunset blocks new memberships and new offers while preserving existing Profiles (§ 4.3); enforcement of those blocks at the membership/offer surfaces is a downstream concern, not part of this transition.

A Club in `sunset` SHALL transition to `closed` on a `CloseClub` operation, recording **`ClubClosed`**. The PRD precondition that closure occurs only once all members have migrated or expired (§ 4.3) reads Profile state, which does not exist in this slice; it is a **deferred seam** — `CloseClub` SHALL implement the transition without enforcing an all-members-gone gate (vacuously satisfiable today, as no Profile can be `Active` without the demand-side transitions), and the demand-side change SHALL tighten it.

Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded** against a transaction-locked re-read: a `SunsetClub` on a Club not in `active`, or a `CloseClub` on a Club not in `sunset` (including an attempt to close an `active` Club directly), SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalClubTransition` and SHALL leave all state and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Sunset an active Club

- **WHEN** `SunsetClub` is invoked on a Club in `active`
- **THEN** the Club's status becomes `sunset` and a `ClubSunset` event is recorded in the same transaction

#### Scenario: Close a sunset Club

- **WHEN** `CloseClub` is invoked on a Club in `sunset`
- **THEN** the Club's status becomes `closed` and a `ClubClosed` event is recorded — no all-members-gone precondition is enforced in this slice (the gate is a deferred seam)

#### Scenario: Illegal Club transitions are rejected

- **WHEN** `SunsetClub` is invoked on a Club not in `active`, or `CloseClub` on a Club not in `sunset` (e.g. an `active` Club)
- **THEN** an `IllegalClubTransition` is raised, the Club's status is unchanged, and no `ClubSunset` / `ClubClosed` event is recorded

### Requirement: Supply-Side Lifecycle Events

Each supply-side transition SHALL record its **verbatim** Module K event — `ProducerActivated`, `ProducerRetired`, `ProducerAgreementActivated`, `ProducerAgreementSuperseded`, `ProducerAgreementTerminated`, `ClubSunset`, `ClubClosed` — through the platform `DomainEventRecorder`, **within the same database transaction** as the state write, tagged with module `parties`, the acting `actor_role` and id resolved from the `ActorContext` seam, the entity type (`Producer` / `ProducerAgreement` / `Club`) and id, and a **PII-free** payload (entity ids + enum/business values only — these three entities carry no personal data, and other parties are referenced by id only). No event name outside this set, and no demand-side lifecycle event, SHALL be recorded by this change.

The two **derived** event chains SHALL be causally linked using the recorder's `causationId` / `correlationId`: each cascade `ClubSunset` SHALL carry the `id` of the `ProducerRetired` event as its `causation_id` and share that event's `correlation_id`; the `ProducerAgreementSuperseded` recorded during an activation SHALL carry the `id` of the `ProducerAgreementActivated` event as its `causation_id` and share its `correlation_id`. The supersession pair SHALL additionally carry the linkage in payload — the `ProducerAgreementSuperseded` payload references the **superseding** agreement id, and the `ProducerAgreementActivated` payload references the **superseded** agreement id (null when the activation superseded nothing).

#### Scenario: Each transition records its verbatim event PII-free in the same transaction

- **WHEN** any supply-side transition runs
- **THEN** exactly its corresponding event (from the seven-name set) is recorded in the writing transaction, tagged module `parties` with the entity type/id and an `actor_role` from `ActorContext`, and its payload contains only entity ids and enum/business values (no name, email, phone or other personal data)

#### Scenario: Cascade events are causally linked to the retirement

- **WHEN** `RetireProducer` cascades to sunset N operated Clubs
- **THEN** the `ProducerRetired` event is the root and each of the N `ClubSunset` events carries that event's `id` as `causation_id` and shares its `correlation_id`

#### Scenario: Supersession events pair old and new

- **WHEN** activating an agreement supersedes a prior active one in the same scope
- **THEN** the `ProducerAgreementActivated` payload references the superseded agreement id, the `ProducerAgreementSuperseded` payload references the superseding agreement id, and the supersession event is caused by (and shares the correlation of) the activation event

### Requirement: Customer KYC Lifecycle

The Customer SHALL carry a **KYC lifecycle that is separate from the Customer status FSM**: the four-state domain `not_required → pending → verified | rejected`, held in an **additive nullable** `kyc_status` field (DEC-071 — a NULL `kyc_status` denotes a Customer created un-screened). The Customer SHALL also carry an administratively-set `kyc_required` flag and an enhanced-KYC trigger flag + timestamp, both additive nullable.

Setting `kyc_required` SHALL transition KYC `not_required → pending`. A Customer in KYC `pending` SHALL transition to `verified` (identity verification cleared) or to `rejected` (failed) via explicit operator Actions that are the sole writers of `kyc_status`. KYC `verified` and `not_required` are the **cleared** (non-blocking) states; `pending` and `rejected` are blocking. The blocking effect on purchases is realized by the **`kyc` Hold** (the *Hold Registry*): setting `kyc_required` SHALL **auto-place** a Customer-scope `kyc` Hold within the same transaction as the `not_required → pending` write; recording `verified` SHALL **auto-lift** the Customer's active `kyc` Hold(s) within the same transaction (the system auto-lift the per-type discipline permits — DEC-160); recording `rejected` SHALL **leave** the `kyc` Hold in place (Compliance reviews case-by-case — § 9.1). This coupling is within-module Action orchestration (the KYC Action calls the Hold place/lift), since KYC records no domain event of its own.

The enhanced-KYC trigger flag + timestamp SHALL exist as additive nullable fields recording whether the Customer crossed the €10,000-single / €50,000-cumulative threshold. The **detection** of that crossing (the periodic scan and the at-order-completion check) reads cumulative-spend data that does not exist at launch and is **deferred**; only the fields ship.

KYC state changes SHALL record **no KYC domain event** (the PRD event catalog § 15.1 names none); the KYC change is captured in the append-only audit trail only, while the coupled `kyc` Hold place/lift records its own `CustomerHoldPlaced` / `CustomerHoldLifted` (per the *Hold Events* requirement). Every KYC transition SHALL be **from-state guarded** against a transaction-locked re-read and SHALL reject an out-of-state call with a localized `IllegalKycTransition`, leaving state and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: The kyc_required flag transitions not_required to pending and auto-places the kyc Hold

- **WHEN** an operator sets a Customer's `kyc_required` flag and the Customer's `kyc_status` is `not_required` or NULL
- **THEN** `kyc_status` becomes `pending`, a Customer-scope `kyc` Hold is auto-placed in the same transaction, and the only domain event recorded is `CustomerHoldPlaced` (KYC itself records no event)

#### Scenario: Verified auto-lifts the kyc Hold; rejected leaves it in place

- **WHEN** a Customer in KYC `pending` (with an active `kyc` Hold) is recorded `verified`
- **THEN** `kyc_status` becomes `verified` (a cleared state), the active `kyc` Hold is auto-lifted, and `CustomerHoldLifted` is recorded (KYC itself records no event)
- **WHEN** a Customer in KYC `pending` is recorded `rejected`
- **THEN** `kyc_status` becomes `rejected` (a blocking state), the `kyc` Hold remains in place (no automatic onward transition — Compliance reviews case-by-case), and no Hold event is recorded

#### Scenario: The KYC FSM is separate from the Customer status FSM

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** `kyc_status` is a field and FSM distinct from the Customer status (`pending / active / suspended / closed`), and a KYC transition does not move the Customer status

#### Scenario: Enhanced-KYC fields exist but detection is deferred

- **WHEN** a Customer is inspected
- **THEN** it carries a nullable enhanced-KYC flag and timestamp, and there is no operation in this change that auto-sets them from purchase totals (the detection job is a documented seam)

#### Scenario: Illegal KYC transitions are rejected

- **WHEN** `RecordKycVerified` or `RecordKycRejected` is invoked on a Customer whose `kyc_status` is not `pending`
- **THEN** an `IllegalKycTransition` is raised, `kyc_status` is unchanged, and no `kyc` Hold is placed or lifted

The enhanced-KYC detection job (AC-K-J-7a) remains a deferred seam._

### Requirement: Customer Sanctions Screening Lifecycle

The Customer SHALL carry a **sanctions-screening lifecycle that is separate from both the Customer status FSM and the KYC FSM, and independent of KYC**: the four-state domain `pending → passed | failed | under_review` plus `under_review → passed | failed`, held in additive nullable fields (DEC-071) — `sanctions_status`, `last_screening_at`, `next_rescreen_at`, and the screening `trigger_source` (`onboarding | cadence | aml_threshold | compliance_ad_hoc`). A NULL `sanctions_status` denotes a Customer created un-screened and SHALL be treated, for any downstream purchase gate, as not-`passed` (blocked) — exactly like `pending`.

An explicit operator Action SHALL record each screening verdict (manual-first — the screen is the floor, the vendor integration is deferrable): it SHALL set `sanctions_status` to the verdict, stamp `last_screening_at`, set `next_rescreen_at` to the 12-month-forward moment, record the `trigger_source`, and (on a `passed`/`failed` completion) record the matching screening event per the *Sanctions Screening Events* requirement. A verdict carrying `trigger_source = onboarding` SHALL be the Customer's **first** screening (rejected with `IllegalSanctionsTransition` if `last_screening_at` is already set); every other `trigger_source` denotes a **re-screen**.

The sanctions lifecycle SHALL be **independent of KYC**: a sanctions transition SHALL NOT change `kyc_status` and a KYC transition SHALL NOT change `sanctions_status`; the two clear independently. The **enforcement** of `sanctions_status = passed` as a purchase precondition is **Module S's** at order completion (Module K is sanctions-blind by design) and is NOT in this change.

The **automated 12-month re-screen cadence** (the daily background job) and the **AML-threshold auto re-screen** (the cumulative-totals scan) are **deferred** (manual-first); the operator ad-hoc re-screen Action, the four events, the `trigger_source` field and the `next_rescreen_at` field ship now.

#### Scenario: Onboarding screening records the first verdict and event

- **WHEN** an operator records an onboarding sanctions screening of `passed` for a Customer whose `sanctions_status` is NULL or `pending` (no prior `last_screening_at`)
- **THEN** `sanctions_status` becomes `passed`, `last_screening_at` is stamped, `next_rescreen_at` is set 12 months forward, `trigger_source` is `onboarding`, and a `CustomerOnboardingScreeningPassed` event is recorded
- **WHEN** the onboarding verdict is `failed`
- **THEN** `sanctions_status` becomes `failed` and a `CustomerOnboardingScreeningFailed` event is recorded

#### Scenario: under_review resolves to passed or failed

- **WHEN** a Customer in `under_review` is re-screened to `passed` (resp. `failed`)
- **THEN** `sanctions_status` becomes that verdict and the matching `CustomerRescreening*` event is recorded

#### Scenario: Re-screening records the rescreening events with the trigger source

- **WHEN** an operator runs an ad-hoc re-screen on a previously-screened Customer to `passed`, with `trigger_source = compliance_ad_hoc`
- **THEN** `sanctions_status` becomes `passed`, `trigger_source` is recorded as `compliance_ad_hoc`, and a `CustomerRescreeningPassed` event is recorded

#### Scenario: Sanctions and KYC are independent state machines

- **WHEN** one Customer has `kyc_status = verified` and `sanctions_status = pending`, and another has `sanctions_status = passed` and `kyc_status = pending`
- **THEN** each pair is recorded independently — no sanctions transition changes `kyc_status` and no KYC transition changes `sanctions_status` (the purchase-gate consequence of each non-clean state is enforced downstream, not in this slice)

#### Scenario: Automated cadence and AML detection are deferred; the fields and ad-hoc path ship

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** `last_screening_at`, `next_rescreen_at` and `trigger_source` exist and an operator can record an ad-hoc re-screen, but there is no daily cadence job and no cumulative-totals scan in this change (documented seams)

#### Scenario: An onboarding screening on an already-screened Customer is rejected

- **WHEN** a verdict with `trigger_source = onboarding` is recorded for a Customer whose `last_screening_at` is already set
- **THEN** an `IllegalSanctionsTransition` is raised and the sanctions state is unchanged

The order-completion enforcement (AC-K-J-20) is Module S's; the cadence/AML automation is deferred._

### Requirement: Producer KYC Lifecycle

The Producer SHALL carry a **provenance-KYC lifecycle distinct from Customer KYC**: the four-state domain `not_required → pending → verified | rejected`, held in an additive nullable `kyc_status` field (DEC-071). A NULL `kyc_status` denotes a Producer never touched by KYC and SHALL be treated as **cleared** at the activation gate (so existing and never-screened Producers keep activating — see *Producer Lifecycle*).

Operator Actions SHALL be the sole writers of the Producer `kyc_status`: a require operation (`not_required`/NULL → `pending`), a verified operation (`pending → verified`), a rejected operation (`pending → rejected`), and a **waive** operation (→ `not_required`) — the operator "deselect" that clears the gate exactly as `verified`. KYC `verified` and `not_required` are the **cleared** states; `pending` and `rejected` block. Producer KYC changes record **no domain event** (the PRD names none); the cleared semantics are carried by `ProducerActivated` when activation fires. Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded** and reject an out-of-state call with a localized `IllegalKycTransition`, leaving state unchanged.

#### Scenario: Require, verify, reject the Producer KYC

- **WHEN** the require operation is invoked on a Producer whose `kyc_status` is NULL or `not_required`
- **THEN** `kyc_status` becomes `pending`
- **WHEN** the Producer in `pending` is recorded `verified` (resp. `rejected`)
- **THEN** `kyc_status` becomes that state, and no domain event is recorded

#### Scenario: Operator waives Producer KYC to not_required

- **WHEN** the waive operation is invoked on a Producer in `pending` or `rejected`
- **THEN** `kyc_status` becomes `not_required` (a cleared state) — the operator-deselect that lets the Producer activate as if verified

#### Scenario: Producer KYC is distinct from Customer KYC

- **WHEN** the Producer entity is inspected
- **THEN** its `kyc_status` is a Producer-level field independent of any Customer KYC state

#### Scenario: Illegal Producer KYC transitions are rejected

- **WHEN** the verified or rejected operation is invoked on a Producer not in `pending`
- **THEN** an `IllegalKycTransition` is raised and `kyc_status` is unchanged

### Requirement: Sanctions Screening Events

Each sanctions screening **completion** SHALL record its **verbatim** Module K event through the platform `DomainEventRecorder`, within the same database transaction as the `sanctions_status` write, tagged module `parties`, the acting `actor_role` and id from the `ActorContext` seam, entity type `Customer` and id, and a **PII-free** payload (customer id plus the verdict / `trigger_source` enum values only — never name, email, phone or date of birth). The four event names are `CustomerOnboardingScreeningPassed`, `CustomerOnboardingScreeningFailed` (recorded when the **onboarding** screening completes), and `CustomerRescreeningPassed`, `CustomerRescreeningFailed` (recorded when any **re-screen** completes). A screening landing `under_review` is **not** a completion and SHALL record **no** event. No event name outside this set, and **no KYC event**, SHALL be recorded by this change.

#### Scenario: Onboarding completion records the onboarding event

- **WHEN** an onboarding screening completes `passed` (resp. `failed`)
- **THEN** `CustomerOnboardingScreeningPassed` (resp. `CustomerOnboardingScreeningFailed`) is recorded in the writing transaction, module `parties`, with a PII-free payload

#### Scenario: Re-screen completion records the rescreening event

- **WHEN** a re-screen (`trigger_source` cadence / aml_threshold / compliance_ad_hoc) completes `passed` (resp. `failed`)
- **THEN** `CustomerRescreeningPassed` (resp. `CustomerRescreeningFailed`) is recorded, PII-free

#### Scenario: under_review records no event

- **WHEN** a screening lands `under_review`
- **THEN** `sanctions_status` becomes `under_review` and no screening event is recorded; a later resolution to `passed`/`failed` records the corresponding `CustomerRescreening*` event

#### Scenario: No KYC event is recorded

- **WHEN** any KYC transition runs (Customer or Producer)
- **THEN** no domain event is recorded for it (audit only) — the PRD names no KYC event

### Requirement: Hold Registry

The Parties module SHALL provide a **unified, trigger-agnostic Hold registry** — the single account-restriction primitive that gates commercial activity. A Hold SHALL carry: a `hold_type` from the six-value domain `admin | kyc | payment | fraud | compliance | credit`; a **scope** comprising a `scope_type` from `customer | account | profile` and a `scope_id` (the id of the scoped Customer, Account or Profile — a within-module reference); a `status` from `active | lifted` (born `active`); an optional placement `reason`; the placement actor (role + id, from the `ActorContext` seam) and the placement moment; and, once lifted, the lift actor + lift moment + an optional `lift_reason`. The Hold SHALL be a new `parties_holds` table (the module-table-prefix convention) added by a single **additive** migration; its value-set columns SHALL carry the layered enforcement idiom (a string column + the backed-enum cast on both engines, plus a PostgreSQL-only `CHECK` deriving from `Enum::cases()`).

A scope MAY carry **multiple concurrent `active` Holds** (any one of which blocks the activity it gates — the blocking is the downstream surface's, per the *Hold and Sanctions Read-API* requirement). Module K SHALL be the **registry-of-record** for every Hold, and the registry SHALL be **trigger-agnostic**: it records the type and state of a Hold regardless of how the placement was triggered, and a **manual operator-placement path** SHALL exist for every type (the automatic triggers for `payment`/`fraud`/`compliance`/`credit` are Module E/S signals deferred to those modules; the registry is unchanged by their automation depth). The `hold_type` enum SHALL expose an `autoLiftable(): bool` predicate that is true for `kyc` and `payment` only (consumed by the *Hold Lifecycle and Lift Discipline* requirement).

#### Scenario: The Hold entity carries its type, scope, status and audit metadata

- **WHEN** a Hold is placed on a scope with a type
- **THEN** a `parties_holds` row persists carrying the `hold_type`, the `scope_type` + `scope_id`, `status = active`, the placement actor (role + id) and the placement moment, and (until lifted) a null lift actor / lift moment

#### Scenario: The six Hold types and the three scopes are the domain

- **WHEN** the `HoldType` and `HoldScope` enums are inspected
- **THEN** `HoldType` is exactly `admin | kyc | payment | fraud | compliance | credit` and `HoldScope` is exactly `customer | account | profile`, each a string-backed enum whose `->value` is the spec token
- **AND** `HoldType::autoLiftable()` is true for `kyc` and `payment` and false for `admin`, `fraud`, `compliance`, `credit`

#### Scenario: Multiple concurrent Holds may exist on one scope

- **WHEN** a `kyc` Hold and an `admin` Hold are both placed on one Customer
- **THEN** both are recorded `active` on that Customer scope concurrently (the scope is not single-Hold)

#### Scenario: The registry is trigger-agnostic with a manual-placement path for every type

- **WHEN** an operator manually places a Hold of any of the six types
- **THEN** the Hold is recorded identically regardless of type — Module K is the registry-of-record, and no automatic upstream trigger is required for the record to exist

### Requirement: Hold Lifecycle and Lift Discipline

A Hold SHALL be placed and lifted by explicit operator Actions that are the sole writers of `parties_holds`, each running inside one `DB::transaction`. `PlaceHold` SHALL create a Hold (`status = active`) recording the placement actor, moment and optional `reason`, and SHALL record the `CustomerHoldPlaced` event (per the *Hold Events* requirement) in the same transaction. `LiftHold` SHALL re-read the Hold under a transaction lock, set `status = lifted` recording the lift actor, lift moment and optional `lift_reason`, and record `CustomerHoldLifted` in the same transaction.

`LiftHold` SHALL enforce the **per-type lift discipline** (DEC-160; ADR `2026-06-18-hold-lift-discipline-per-type.md`): a Hold whose type is **auto-managed** (`HoldType::autoLiftable()` — `kyc` or `payment`) SHALL NOT be lifted by the operator path and SHALL be **rejected** with a localized `IllegalHoldLift`, because those types are lifted by the system on their clearing signal (the `kyc` auto-lift is wired in this change via the *Customer KYC Lifecycle* requirement; the `payment` auto-lift trigger is a deferred Module-E seam). A Hold of type `admin`, `fraud`, `compliance` or `credit` SHALL be lifted freely by the operator path. Lifting a Hold that is not `active` (already `lifted`) SHALL be **rejected** with a localized `IllegalHoldLift`, leaving state and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Place a Hold records the placement actor, reason and moment

- **WHEN** `PlaceHold` is invoked with a type, a scope and a reason
- **THEN** an `active` Hold persists carrying that type, scope, reason, the placement actor (from `ActorContext`) and the placement moment, and a `CustomerHoldPlaced` event is recorded in the same transaction

#### Scenario: An operator lifts an operator-liftable Hold

- **WHEN** `LiftHold` is invoked on an `active` `admin` (resp. `fraud`, `compliance`, `credit`) Hold
- **THEN** the Hold's `status` becomes `lifted`, the lift actor + lift moment + `lift_reason` are recorded, and a `CustomerHoldLifted` event is recorded in the same transaction

#### Scenario: Operator-lift of an auto-managed Hold is rejected

- **WHEN** `LiftHold` is invoked on an `active` `kyc` or `payment` Hold (an auto-managed type)
- **THEN** an `IllegalHoldLift` is raised, the Hold stays `active`, and no `CustomerHoldLifted` event is recorded — these types lift only via their system clearing signal

#### Scenario: Lifting an already-lifted Hold is rejected

- **WHEN** `LiftHold` is invoked on a Hold whose `status` is already `lifted`
- **THEN** an `IllegalHoldLift` is raised and state and the event log are unchanged

### Requirement: Hold Events

Each Hold placement SHALL record a verbatim **`CustomerHoldPlaced`** domain event and each Hold lift a verbatim **`CustomerHoldLifted`** domain event (PRD § 15.1) through the platform `DomainEventRecorder`, **within the same database transaction** as the Hold write, tagged with module `parties`, the acting `actor_role` + id from the `ActorContext` seam, `entity_type = 'Hold'` and the Hold id, and a **PII-free** payload carrying the `hold_id`, `hold_type`, `scope_type`, `scope_id` and the business `reason` (no name, email, phone or date of birth). Because the PRD event catalog names only the `Customer`-scoped Hold events, these two names SHALL be recorded for Holds of **every** scope (the `scope_type` + `scope_id` in the payload distinguish a Customer-, Account- or Profile-scoped Hold — the zero-invention reading of AC-K-FSM-10's "or Profile/Account analogs"). No Hold event name outside this pair SHALL be recorded by this change.

#### Scenario: Placing a Hold records a PII-free CustomerHoldPlaced

- **WHEN** a Hold is placed
- **THEN** a `CustomerHoldPlaced` event is recorded in the writing transaction, tagged module `parties`, `entity_type` `Hold`, with a payload of `hold_id` / `hold_type` / `scope_type` / `scope_id` / `reason` and no personal data

#### Scenario: Lifting a Hold records a CustomerHoldLifted

- **WHEN** a Hold is lifted (by the operator path or the system auto-lift)
- **THEN** a `CustomerHoldLifted` event is recorded in the lifting transaction with a PII-free payload referencing the same Hold

#### Scenario: The two Hold event names cover every scope

- **WHEN** an Account-scoped or Profile-scoped Hold is placed
- **THEN** the event recorded is still `CustomerHoldPlaced`, with `scope_type` (`account` / `profile`) + `scope_id` in the payload identifying the scope — no other Hold event name is recorded

### Requirement: Hold and Sanctions Read-API

The Parties module SHALL expose a **uniform read contract** answering *"is this scope clear to transact?"* by returning the **`(sanctions_status, active-Hold-list)` tuple** (DEC-181). The contract SHALL be an interface returning a **PII-free DTO** (carrying the scope's `sanctions_status` and the list of active Hold types — never the `Hold` Eloquent model, preserving the no-model-leak boundary law), with a convenience predicate that a scope **is clear** iff its `sanctions_status` is `passed` **and** it has no `active` Hold. The contract SHALL resolve **scope cascade**: interrogating a **Profile** SHALL return the Profile's own active Holds **and** the active Holds of its parent Customer (a Customer-scope Hold blocks every Profile — BR-K-Hold-3), while a **Profile-scope** Hold SHALL be returned only for that Profile (BR-K-Hold-4).

This change SHALL **expose the contract ready** (interface + DTO + a bound implementation); the **downstream enforcement** that consumes it — every DEC-181 transaction-initiation surface (Module S order completion / cart-add / redemption-request, Module C pickup / SO `planned` / shipment-request, Module E INV3 charge / refund routing) — is the receiving module's and is **NOT** in this change (Module K is Hold-blind by design — it provides the tuple, it does not block).

#### Scenario: The read-API returns the sanctions/Hold tuple for a Customer

- **WHEN** the read contract is asked whether a Customer scope is clear
- **THEN** it returns the Customer's `sanctions_status` and the list of that Customer's active Hold types, and reports "clear" iff `sanctions_status` is `passed` and there is no active Hold

#### Scenario: A Customer-scope Hold cascades to the Customer's Profiles

- **GIVEN** an active Customer-scope `fraud` Hold on a Customer with two Profiles
- **WHEN** the read contract is asked whether either Profile is clear
- **THEN** the Customer's `fraud` Hold appears in that Profile's active-Hold-list and the Profile is reported not clear

#### Scenario: A Profile-scope Hold isolates to that Profile

- **GIVEN** an active Profile-scope `payment` Hold on Profile X of a Customer who also has Profile Y
- **WHEN** the read contract is asked about Profile Y
- **THEN** Profile X's Hold does NOT appear for Profile Y, and Profile Y is clear if it has no Hold of its own and its Customer is sanctions-`passed` with no Customer-scope Hold

#### Scenario: The contract returns a PII-free DTO, not a model

- **WHEN** a downstream module consumes the read contract
- **THEN** it receives a DTO of `sanctions_status` + active Hold types (no `Hold` Eloquent model, no personal data) — and no transaction-initiation enforcement surface is implemented by this change (the consumers are deferred to Modules S/C/E)

### Requirement: Profile Membership Approval

The Profile SHALL transition `Applied → Approved` (membership approval) and `Applied → Rejected` (membership decline) via explicit operator Actions — `ApproveProfile` and `DeclineProfile` — that are the sole writers of the Profile `state` for these transitions, each running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read of the Profile row. These realize **the one retained producer write** ("membership approve/decline", L-PP / K-Q4); the producer-facing HTTP surface is deferred and the Actions are operator/console-invocable at launch (admin-parity, DEC-083).

`ApproveProfile` on a Profile in `Applied` SHALL set `state = Approved`. `DeclineProfile` on a Profile in `Applied` SHALL set `state = Rejected` — a terminal-for-this-application state; a re-application creates a **new** Profile row (per the *Profile — Multi-Profile Membership* requirement), and because the Customer–Club partial-unique index already excludes the terminal `rejected` state, the new `Applied` row inserts with **no** index migration.

Neither approval nor decline SHALL record a Profile lifecycle domain event: the PRD § 15.2 event catalog **names no `ProfileApproved` or `ProfileRejected`**, so — exactly as a KYC transition records no KYC event (audit trail only — the shipped *Customer KYC Lifecycle* precedent) — the state change is captured in the append-only audit trail only. The **sole** domain event the approve path MAY record is the conditional `OriginatingClubLocked`.

On `ApproveProfile`, **if and only if** this is the Customer's **first-ever** Profile approval across any Club — detected by the Customer's `originating_club_id` being currently unset (re-read under a transaction lock) — the Action SHALL, in the same transaction, set `Customer.originating_club_id` to the approving Profile's `club_id` and record an `OriginatingClubLocked` event (per the *Demand-Side Activation Events* requirement). The lock SHALL be **one-shot** (a subsequent approval on another Club neither re-fires the event nor changes the link), **immutable** thereafter (no admin-override surface at launch), and MAY remain unset indefinitely for a Customer never approved into any Club (DEC-040). The Originating-Club lock SHALL NOT be a standalone Action — it is exclusively an in-transaction side-effect of `ApproveProfile`.

The **Hero Package Capacity Invariant** (§ 13) — the membership no-oversell guard the PRD enforces "at every membership approval" — reads the cap from Module A's Hero-Package Allocation `qty` (§ 13.2 / AC-K-XM-18); Module A is unbuilt, so this slice ships `ApproveProfile` **uncapped** with the capacity gate as a documented deferred Module-A seam (the `Applied → WaitingList` capacity-exceeded path is likewise deferred). Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded** against the transaction-locked re-read: an `ApproveProfile` or `DeclineProfile` on a Profile not in `Applied` SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalProfileTransition`, leaving state, the Originating-Club link and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Approve a first-ever applied Profile locks the Originating Club

- **GIVEN** a Customer whose `originating_club_id` is unset, with a Profile in `Applied` for Club C
- **WHEN** `ApproveProfile` is invoked on that Profile
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Approved`, the Customer's `originating_club_id` is set to Club C, and exactly one `OriginatingClubLocked` event is recorded in the same transaction (and no `ProfileApproved` event, which the catalog does not name)

#### Scenario: A second Club's approval does not re-lock or re-fire

- **GIVEN** a Customer whose `originating_club_id` is already set to Club C, with a Profile in `Applied` for a different Club D
- **WHEN** `ApproveProfile` is invoked on the Club-D Profile
- **THEN** that Profile's `state` becomes `Approved`, the Customer's `originating_club_id` stays Club C, and **no** `OriginatingClubLocked` event is recorded

#### Scenario: Decline an applied Profile is terminal and event-silent

- **WHEN** `DeclineProfile` is invoked on a Profile in `Applied`
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Rejected`, **no** domain event is recorded, and a subsequent re-application for the same Customer–Club pair creates a new Profile in `Applied` (the partial-unique index admits it)

#### Scenario: Illegal approve/decline is rejected

- **WHEN** `ApproveProfile` or `DeclineProfile` is invoked on a Profile not in `Applied`
- **THEN** an `IllegalProfileTransition` is raised, the Profile's `state` and the Customer's `originating_club_id` are unchanged, and no event is recorded

### Requirement: Profile Activation

The Profile SHALL transition `Approved → Active` via an explicit `ActivateProfile` Action — the sole writer of the Profile `state` for this transition — running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read, recording a `ProfileActivated` event (per the *Demand-Side Activation Events* requirement) in the same transaction. In production this transition is driven by Module E's `MembershipFeePaid` event (the membership-fee-paid signal) or a free-club activation where no fee applies (§ 4.2.1); Module E does not exist, so the **`MembershipFeePaid` listener is a deferred Module-E seam** — `ActivateProfile` is the within-module writer, invoked by the free-club / operator path now, and **no** Module-E event contract is fabricated. The Hero Package Capacity Invariant gate at the transition-into-`Active` (§ 13.1) reads Module A's Allocation `qty` and is the **same deferred Module-A seam** as approval: `ActivateProfile` ships **uncapped**. Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded**: an `ActivateProfile` on a Profile not in `Approved` SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalProfileTransition`, leaving state and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Activate an approved Profile

- **WHEN** `ActivateProfile` is invoked on a Profile in `Approved`
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Active` and exactly one `ProfileActivated` event is recorded in the same transaction (module `parties`, `entity_type` `Profile`, PII-free payload)

#### Scenario: Illegal activation is rejected

- **WHEN** `ActivateProfile` is invoked on a Profile not in `Approved` (e.g. `Applied` or already `Active`)
- **THEN** an `IllegalProfileTransition` is raised, the Profile's `state` is unchanged, and no `ProfileActivated` event is recorded

#### Scenario: The membership-fee trigger is a deferred seam

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** `ActivateProfile` exists as the within-module writer of `Approved → Active`, and there is **no** `MembershipFeePaid` listener and no fabricated Module-E event class in this change (the cross-module trigger is a documented Module-E seam)

### Requirement: Customer Onboarding Activation

The Customer SHALL transition `pending → active` via an explicit `ActivateCustomer` Action — the sole writer of the Customer `status` for this transition — running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read, recording a `CustomerActivated` event (per the *Demand-Side Activation Events* requirement) in the same transaction. Activation SHALL be a **hard composite gate** — the four onboarding gates plus the KYC-cleared rider: `email_verified_at` set **∧** `tc_accepted_at` set **∧** `privacy_accepted_at` set **∧** `sanctions_status = passed` **∧** KYC **cleared** (`kyc_status` ∈ {`verified`, `not_required`} or NULL) whenever `kyc_required` is set. The three acceptance moments SHALL be **additive nullable timestamp** columns on `parties_customers` (the gate inputs — § 4.1 acceptance is "tracked at Customer level with timestamps"; DEC-071 additive pattern; the physical column shape is the dev-team realization, DEC-073), born `NULL` and written by the (deferred) registration surface or an operator.

Activation SHALL be **explicit**: no sanctions screening verdict, KYC transition, or acceptance write SHALL auto-transition the Customer `status`. The Customer status FSM is separate from and independent of the KYC and sanctions FSMs (§ 9.4), and activation/suspension are explicit — never automatically driven by another FSM or by Profile state (AC-K-BR-Customer-1). Customer activation SHALL perform **no** Account transition: the Account is born `active` (it has no `pending` state — AC-K-FSM-9).

A gate-unmet `ActivateCustomer` (any of the five conditions unmet), or an `ActivateCustomer` on a Customer not in `pending`, SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalCustomerTransition`, leaving `status = pending` and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Activate a Customer once all gates clear

- **GIVEN** a Customer in `pending` with `email_verified_at`, `tc_accepted_at` and `privacy_accepted_at` all set, `sanctions_status = passed`, and KYC cleared (or `kyc_required` unset)
- **WHEN** `ActivateCustomer` is invoked
- **THEN** the Customer's `status` becomes `active` and exactly one `CustomerActivated` event is recorded in the same transaction (module `parties`, `entity_type` `Customer`, PII-free payload), and the Customer's Account `status` is unchanged

#### Scenario: Any unmet gate blocks activation

- **WHEN** `ActivateCustomer` is invoked on a `pending` Customer with any one of the gates unmet — `email_verified_at` null, or `tc_accepted_at` null, or `privacy_accepted_at` null, or `sanctions_status ≠ passed`, or `kyc_required` set while `kyc_status` is `pending`/`rejected`
- **THEN** an `IllegalCustomerTransition` is raised, the Customer stays `pending`, and no `CustomerActivated` event is recorded

#### Scenario: Activation is explicit, not auto-driven by another FSM

- **WHEN** a Customer's sanctions screening is recorded `passed`, or a KYC transition runs, with no `ActivateCustomer` call
- **THEN** the Customer `status` is unchanged (no auto-activation) — the status FSM is independent of the KYC and sanctions FSMs

#### Scenario: Illegal from-state is rejected

- **WHEN** `ActivateCustomer` is invoked on a Customer not in `pending`
- **THEN** an `IllegalCustomerTransition` is raised and the Customer `status` is unchanged

### Requirement: Demand-Side Activation Events

Each demand-side activation transition SHALL record its **verbatim** Module K event — `CustomerActivated` (on Customer `pending → active`), `ProfileActivated` (on Profile `Approved → Active`), `OriginatingClubLocked` (on the Customer's first-ever Profile approval) — through the platform `DomainEventRecorder`, **within the same database transaction** as the state write, tagged with module `parties`, the acting `actor_role` + id resolved from the `ActorContext` seam, the entity type and id, and a **PII-free** payload (entity ids + enum/business values only — never name, email, phone or date of birth). `CustomerActivated` SHALL carry `entity_type = 'Customer'` with payload `{customer_id, status}`; `ProfileActivated` SHALL carry `entity_type = 'Profile'` with payload `{profile_id, state}`; `OriginatingClubLocked` SHALL carry `entity_type = 'Customer'` with payload `{customer_id, club_id, profile_id, locked_at}` — the Customer, the locking Club, the triggering membership and the moment (§ 6.1 verbatim).

The `ApproveProfile` and `DeclineProfile` transitions SHALL record **no** Profile event of their own (audit-only — § 15.2 names none). **No** event name outside this three-name set SHALL be recorded by this change. Each of the three events SHALL be recorded as a **root** event (no `causation_id`; `correlation_id` defaults to its own `event_id`), since the transition it records has no parent event in the same transaction. The downstream consumers `OriginatingClubLocked` names — Module S settlement-eligibility, Module E D19 accrual, HubSpot (§ 6 / § 15.6 / AC-K-EVT-10) — are **not** wired by this change: Module K records the event (the capture); all consumption is downstream and deferred.

#### Scenario: Each activation transition records its verbatim event PII-free

- **WHEN** any of the three activation transitions runs (`ActivateCustomer`, `ActivateProfile`, or the first-approval `ApproveProfile`)
- **THEN** exactly its corresponding event (`CustomerActivated` / `ProfileActivated` / `OriginatingClubLocked`) is recorded in the writing transaction, tagged module `parties`, with the entity type/id and an `actor_role` from `ActorContext`, and its payload contains only entity ids and enum/business values (no name, email, phone or date of birth)

#### Scenario: OriginatingClubLocked carries the four spec fields

- **WHEN** `OriginatingClubLocked` is recorded
- **THEN** its payload is exactly `{customer_id, club_id, profile_id, locked_at}` (the Customer, the locking Club, the triggering membership, and the moment), `entity_type` `Customer`, PII-free

#### Scenario: Approve and decline record no Profile event; nothing outside the set fires

### Requirement: Profile Suspension and Restoration

The Profile SHALL transition `Active → Suspended` via an explicit `SuspendProfile` Action and `Suspended → Active` via an explicit `ReactivateProfile` Action — each the sole writer of the Profile `state` for its transition, running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read, recording a `ProfileSuspended` (respectively `ProfileReactivated`) event (per the *Demand-Side Status Events* requirement) in the same transaction. In production these transitions are driven by the Hold→`suspended` coupling (a Profile-level Hold, or a cascading Customer-level Hold — per the *Hold-Driven Status Coupling* requirement); the Actions are also directly operator-invocable (manual suspension — AC-K-BR-Customer-1 *"explicit (manual or via Hold)"*).

Suspension SHALL be **state-preserving**: `SuspendProfile` SHALL write **only** the Profile `state` — it SHALL NOT cancel vouchers, pending orders or allocation reservations, nor mutate any Club Credit balance. Active vouchers stay ACTIVE, pending orders stay pending, reservations stay reserved (§ 10.1); the Club-Credit freeze-while-suspended / unfreeze-on-restore is a **deferred `club-credit` seam** (the Club Credit entity is unbuilt — Module S/E; there is nothing to freeze in this change, and nothing destructive happens on suspend). Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded**: a `SuspendProfile` on a Profile not in `Active`, or a `ReactivateProfile` on a Profile not in `Suspended`, SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalProfileTransition`, leaving state and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Suspend an active Profile records ProfileSuspended and preserves state

- **WHEN** `SuspendProfile` is invoked on a Profile in `Active`
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Suspended` and exactly one `ProfileSuspended` event is recorded in the same transaction (module `parties`, `entity_type` `Profile`, PII-free payload `{profile_id, state}`)
- **AND** no voucher, order, reservation or Club Credit record is created, cancelled or mutated by the Action (it writes only `Profile.state`)

#### Scenario: Restore a suspended Profile

- **WHEN** `ReactivateProfile` is invoked on a Profile in `Suspended`
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Active` and exactly one `ProfileReactivated` event is recorded in the same transaction

#### Scenario: Illegal suspend or restore is rejected

- **WHEN** `SuspendProfile` is invoked on a Profile not in `Active` (e.g. `Applied`, `Lapsed` or already `Suspended`), or `ReactivateProfile` on a Profile not in `Suspended`
- **THEN** an `IllegalProfileTransition` is raised, the Profile's `state` is unchanged, and no event is recorded

### Requirement: Profile Lapse and Grace Renewal

The Profile SHALL transition `Active → Lapsed` via an explicit `LapseProfile` Action and `Lapsed → Active` via an explicit `RenewProfile` Action — each the sole writer of the Profile `state` for its transition, running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read. `LapseProfile` SHALL set `state = Lapsed`, stamp the additive nullable `lapsed_at` timestamp, and record a **`ProfileExpired`** event (the § 15.2 event for this edge — the catalog names **no** `ProfileLapsed`). `RenewProfile` SHALL set `state = Active`, clear `lapsed_at`, and record a **`ProfileRenewed`** event (the § 15.2 event for the grace renewal — **not** `ProfileReactivated`, which is reserved for `Suspended → Active`).

`RenewProfile` SHALL enforce the **30-day grace window** (DEC-034): it is permitted **only** when `state = Lapsed` **and** the current moment is within 30 days of `lapsed_at`; past the grace window it SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalProfileTransition` (the deferred scheduler instead transitions the Profile `Lapsed → Cancelled` — per the *Profile Cancellation and Deactivation* requirement). The lapse trigger (membership-validity-period expiry, § 4.2.1) and the renewal trigger (Module E's `MembershipFeePaid`, § 15.8) are **deferred seams** — `LapseProfile`/`RenewProfile` are the within-module writers, invoked directly now; **no** Module-E event contract is fabricated. Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded**: a `LapseProfile` on a Profile not in `Active`, or a `RenewProfile` on a Profile not in `Lapsed` (or past grace), SHALL be rejected, leaving state, `lapsed_at` and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Lapse an active Profile

- **WHEN** `LapseProfile` is invoked on a Profile in `Active`
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Lapsed`, `lapsed_at` is stamped, and exactly one `ProfileExpired` event is recorded in the same transaction (and **no** `ProfileLapsed` event, which the catalog does not name)

#### Scenario: Renew a lapsed Profile within the 30-day grace

- **GIVEN** a Profile in `Lapsed` whose `lapsed_at` is within the last 30 days
- **WHEN** `RenewProfile` is invoked
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Active`, `lapsed_at` is cleared, and exactly one `ProfileRenewed` event is recorded (not `ProfileReactivated`)

#### Scenario: Renewal past the grace window is rejected

- **GIVEN** a Profile in `Lapsed` whose `lapsed_at` is more than 30 days ago
- **WHEN** `RenewProfile` is invoked
- **THEN** an `IllegalProfileTransition` is raised, the Profile stays `Lapsed`, and no event is recorded

#### Scenario: The lapse and renewal triggers are deferred seams

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** `LapseProfile` and `RenewProfile` exist as the within-module writers, and there is **no** validity-period scheduler and **no** `MembershipFeePaid` listener or fabricated Module-E event class in this change

_Source: spec/02-prd/Module_K_PRD_v0.3-MVP.md § 4.2.1 (`Active → Lapsed` on validity-period expiry, stamps `lapsed_at`; `Lapsed → Active` within the 30-day grace on a renewal payment; `Lapsed → Cancelled` after 30 days), § 15.2 (`ProfileExpired` on `Active → Lapsed`; `ProfileRenewed` when a renewal cycle's `MembershipFeePaid` extends validity), § 15.8 (`MembershipFeePaid` is a Module E event Module K consumes) · spec/03-acceptance/Module_K_Acceptance_v0.3-MVP.md AC-K-FSM-12 (lapsed grace: 30-day return-to-active, else terminal Cancelled), AC-K-BR-Profile-3 (30-day grace, no re-application), AC-K-EVT-5 (`ProfileExpired`/`ProfileRenewed`) · spec/04-decisions/decisions.md DEC-034 (30-day lapsed grace) · openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-19-parties-membership-activation (the precedent: ship the transition with the upstream trigger as a documented seam)._

### Requirement: Profile Cancellation and Deactivation

The Profile SHALL transition `Active | Lapsed → Cancelled` via an explicit `CancelProfile` Action and `Active → Inactive` via an explicit `DeactivateProfile` Action — each the sole writer of the Profile `state` for its transition, running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read. Both `Cancelled` and `Inactive` are **terminal soft-delete** states: the Profile is **never hard-deleted** at launch, preserving audit history (re-entry requires a fresh application, except the lapse-grace path). `CancelProfile` SHALL set `state = Cancelled` and record the optional Producer-initiated `cancellation_reason`; `DeactivateProfile` SHALL set `state = Inactive` and record a `ProfileInactive` event.

`CancelProfile` SHALL record **no** domain event — the § 15.2 Profile event family names **no `ProfileCancelled`**, and § 15.7 explicitly defers the cancellation-signal shape as a downstream consumer concern; so (exactly as `ApproveProfile`/`DeclineProfile` are audit-only) the `state = Cancelled` write captured in the append-only audit trail **is** the record. The per-Profile cancellation **signal** Module S consumes for Club-Credit conversion at Producer offboarding (AC-K-EVT-14 / § 10.2 / DEC-043) is a **deferred Module-S seam**: this change ships the within-module `→ Cancelled` transition + the cancellation reason, not the offboarding orchestration. Because the Customer–Club partial-unique index already excludes the terminal `{rejected, cancelled, inactive}` states, a `Cancelled` (or `Inactive`) Profile SHALL NOT block a fresh `Applied` Profile for the same Customer–Club pair — with no index migration. Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded**: a `CancelProfile` on a Profile not in `Active`/`Lapsed`, or a `DeactivateProfile` on a Profile not in `Active`, SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalProfileTransition`.

#### Scenario: Cancel an active Profile is terminal and event-silent

- **WHEN** `CancelProfile` is invoked on a Profile in `Active` (or `Lapsed`) with a cancellation reason
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Cancelled`, the `cancellation_reason` is recorded, **no** domain event is recorded (the catalog names no `ProfileCancelled`), and a subsequent application for the same Customer–Club pair creates a new Profile in `Applied` (the partial-unique index admits it)

#### Scenario: Deactivate an active Profile records ProfileInactive

- **WHEN** `DeactivateProfile` is invoked on a Profile in `Active`
- **THEN** the Profile's `state` becomes `Inactive` and exactly one `ProfileInactive` event is recorded in the same transaction

#### Scenario: Illegal cancel or deactivate is rejected

- **WHEN** `CancelProfile` is invoked on a Profile not in `Active`/`Lapsed`, or `DeactivateProfile` on a Profile not in `Active`
- **THEN** an `IllegalProfileTransition` is raised, the Profile's `state` is unchanged, and no event is recorded

### Requirement: Customer Suspension and Closure

The Customer SHALL transition `active → suspended` via `SuspendCustomer`, `suspended → active` via `ReactivateCustomer`, and `active | suspended → closed` via `CloseCustomer` — each the sole writer of the Customer `status` for its transition, running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read, recording (respectively) a `CustomerSuspended`, `CustomerReactivated`, or `CustomerClosed` event in the same transaction. Suspension SHALL be **explicit** — manual (operator) or via the Hold coupling — and SHALL NOT be automatically driven by Profile state changes or by a KYC/sanctions verdict (the status FSM is independent of the compliance FSMs — § 9.4; AC-K-BR-Customer-1).

`SuspendCustomer` SHALL **cascade** to the Customer's Profiles: in the same transaction it SHALL transition every Profile currently in `Active` to `Suspended` (recording one `ProfileSuspended` per Profile — § 15.1 *"Cascades to all the Customer's Profiles"*); non-`Active` Profiles are skipped (the FSM has only `Active → Suspended`; the Customer-scope Hold blocks them logically via the read-API). `ReactivateCustomer` SHALL cascade-restore every Profile currently in `Suspended` to `Active` (recording `ProfileReactivated`) **iff** that Profile is no longer covered by any active Hold (a Profile retaining its own active Hold — or under a Customer that retains another active Hold — stays `Suspended`). `CloseCustomer` SHALL **not** cascade to Profiles — § 15.1 `CustomerClosed` names no cascade (contrast `CustomerSuspended`); `closed` is **terminal** and is **orthogonal to** anonymisation (a `closed` Customer stays admin-queryable until separately anonymised — AC-K-BR-Customer-2; anonymisation is out of scope). Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded**: a `SuspendCustomer` on a Customer not in `active`, a `ReactivateCustomer` not in `suspended`, or a `CloseCustomer` not in `active`/`suspended`, SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalCustomerTransition`, leaving status, the cascade and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Suspend an active Customer cascades to its active Profiles

- **GIVEN** a Customer in `active` with two Profiles in `Active` and one in `Lapsed`
- **WHEN** `SuspendCustomer` is invoked
- **THEN** the Customer's `status` becomes `suspended` and one `CustomerSuspended` event is recorded, AND each of the two `Active` Profiles becomes `Suspended` with one `ProfileSuspended` each, AND the `Lapsed` Profile is unchanged

#### Scenario: Restore a Customer reactivates only the Profiles no longer covered by a Hold

- **GIVEN** a `suspended` Customer whose suspension cascaded two Profiles to `Suspended`, one of which also carries its own active Profile-scope Hold
- **WHEN** `ReactivateCustomer` is invoked (the Customer-scope Hold having been lifted)
- **THEN** the Customer's `status` becomes `active` with one `CustomerReactivated` event, AND the Profile with no remaining Hold returns to `Active` with one `ProfileReactivated`, AND the Profile still carrying its own active Hold stays `Suspended`

#### Scenario: Close a Customer is terminal and does not cascade to Profiles

- **WHEN** `CloseCustomer` is invoked on a Customer in `active` or `suspended`
- **THEN** the Customer's `status` becomes `closed`, one `CustomerClosed` event is recorded, and no Profile is transitioned by the Action (closure names no cascade)

#### Scenario: Illegal Customer status transition is rejected

- **WHEN** `SuspendCustomer` is invoked on a Customer not in `active`, or `ReactivateCustomer` not in `suspended`, or `CloseCustomer` not in `active`/`suspended`
- **THEN** an `IllegalCustomerTransition` is raised and the Customer `status` (and any Profiles) are unchanged

### Requirement: Account Status Lifecycle

The Account SHALL transition `active → suspended` via `SuspendAccount`, `suspended → active` via `ReactivateAccount`, and `active | suspended → closed` via `CloseAccount` — each the sole writer of the Account `status` for its transition, running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read. These transitions SHALL record **no** domain event: the PRD § 15 event catalog names **no** Account-family event (the Account is event-silent at creation too — it records no `AccountCreated`), so the `status` write captured in the append-only audit trail **is** the record. In production `active → suspended` is driven by an Account-level Hold and `suspended → active` by its lift (per the *Hold-Driven Status Coupling* requirement); the Actions are also directly operator-invocable.

The Account SHALL have **no** `ActivateAccount` Action: the Account is born `active` (it has no `pending` state — AC-K-FSM-9), so its only `→ active` edge is the restore `ReactivateAccount`. Every transition SHALL be **from-state guarded**: a `SuspendAccount` on an Account not in `active`, a `ReactivateAccount` not in `suspended`, or a `CloseAccount` not in `active`/`suspended`, SHALL be rejected with a localized `IllegalAccountTransition`, leaving status and the event log unchanged.

#### Scenario: Suspend and restore an Account, event-silently

- **WHEN** `SuspendAccount` is invoked on an Account in `active`, then `ReactivateAccount` on the resulting `suspended` Account
- **THEN** the Account's `status` becomes `suspended` then `active` again, and **no** domain event is recorded by either transition (the catalog names no Account event)

#### Scenario: Close an Account is terminal

- **WHEN** `CloseAccount` is invoked on an Account in `active` or `suspended`
- **THEN** the Account's `status` becomes `closed` and no domain event is recorded

#### Scenario: Account has no activation Action and rejects illegal transitions

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected, and `SuspendAccount`/`ReactivateAccount`/`CloseAccount` are invoked from a wrong from-state
- **THEN** no `ActivateAccount` Action exists (the Account is born `active`), and each wrong-from-state call raises a localized `IllegalAccountTransition` leaving `status` unchanged

### Requirement: Hold-Driven Status Coupling

Placing and lifting a Hold SHALL drive the demand-side status of the covered scopes — closing the seam the *Birth States Recorded, Lifecycle Transitions Deferred* requirement held open (*"placing a Hold records the Hold but performs no status transition"*). A status-bearing scope (Customer, Account, Profile) SHALL be `suspended` **iff** it is covered by at least one **active** Hold, where coverage is: an active Hold on that exact scope, **plus** — for a Profile — an active **Customer-scope** Hold on its owning Customer (the BR-K-Hold-3 cascade; Profile-scope and Account-scope Holds isolate — BR-K-Hold-4). This is **recomputed from Hold coverage** on every placement/lift, not tracked by provenance (decisions/2026-06-19-hold-status-coupling.md).

`PlaceHold` SHALL, in its recording transaction and after appending the Hold, drive every covered scope **currently in its suspendable from-state** to `suspended` by invoking the matching explicit Action — `scope_type = customer` ⇒ `SuspendCustomer` (cascading to the Customer's `Active` Profiles), `account` ⇒ `SuspendAccount`, `profile` ⇒ `SuspendProfile`. A Hold whose covered scope is **not** in its suspendable from-state SHALL record the Hold and perform **no** transition — in particular the `kyc` Hold auto-placed on a **`pending`** Customer at onboarding suspends nothing (the from-state guard preserves the independence of the status FSM from the KYC/sanctions FSMs). `LiftHold` (operator) and the system `kyc`-lift in `RecordKycVerified` SHALL, after lifting, **restore** every covered scope **currently `suspended`** to `active` by invoking the matching `Reactivate*` Action — **iff** re-querying coverage shows **no other active Hold** still covers that scope (BR-K-Hold-1: many Holds may coexist; restore only when the last covering Hold is gone). The coupling SHALL remain **within Module K** (no cross-module access) and SHALL record the status events (`CustomerSuspended`/`ProfileSuspended`/… and their reactivations) per the *Demand-Side Status Events* requirement; a Hold placement/lift that drives no transition records only its own `CustomerHoldPlaced`/`CustomerHoldLifted`.

#### Scenario: Placing a Hold on an active scope suspends it

- **WHEN** `PlaceHold` records an `admin` Hold whose scope is an `active` Customer (respectively an `active` Account, an `Active` Profile)
- **THEN** in the same transaction the scope transitions to `suspended` and the corresponding suspension event(s) are recorded (a Customer-scope Hold additionally cascades `ProfileSuspended` to the Customer's `Active` Profiles)

#### Scenario: A Hold on a non-suspendable scope drives no transition

- **WHEN** the `kyc` Hold is auto-placed on a Customer in `pending` (onboarding KYC), or a Hold is placed on a Profile in `Applied`
- **THEN** the Hold is recorded (`CustomerHoldPlaced`) but the scope's status is unchanged and no suspension event is recorded (the from-state guard — the status FSM stays independent of the KYC/sanctions FSMs)

#### Scenario: Lifting the last covering Hold restores; an earlier lift with coverage remaining does not

- **GIVEN** a Profile driven to `Suspended` while it carries two active Holds (its own `admin` Hold and a cascading Customer-scope Hold)
- **WHEN** one of the two Holds is lifted
- **THEN** the Profile stays `Suspended` (coverage remains); **WHEN** the second (last covering) Hold is lifted **THEN** the Profile returns to `Active` with one `ProfileReactivated`

### Requirement: Demand-Side Status Events

Each demand-side status transition SHALL record its **verbatim** Module K event — `CustomerSuspended` (Customer `active → suspended`), `CustomerReactivated` (`suspended → active`), `CustomerClosed` (`active | suspended → closed`), `ProfileSuspended` (Profile `Active → Suspended`), `ProfileReactivated` (`Suspended → Active`), `ProfileExpired` (`Active → Lapsed`), `ProfileRenewed` (`Lapsed → Active`), `ProfileInactive` (`Active → Inactive`) — through the platform `DomainEventRecorder`, **within the same database transaction** as the state write, tagged with module `parties`, the acting `actor_role` + id from the `ActorContext` seam, the entity type and id, and a **PII-free** payload (entity ids + enum/business values only — never name, email, phone or date of birth). The Customer events SHALL carry `entity_type = 'Customer'` with payload `{customer_id, status}`; the Profile events SHALL carry `entity_type = 'Profile'` with payload `{profile_id, state}`.

The `CancelProfile` transition (`→ Cancelled`) and **all** Account transitions (`SuspendAccount`/`ReactivateAccount`/`CloseAccount`) SHALL record **no** domain event (audit-only — § 15.2 names no `ProfileCancelled`; § 15 names no Account event). **No** event name outside the eight-name set above SHALL be recorded by this change (no `ProfileLapsed`, `ProfileCancelled`, `AccountSuspended`, `AccountClosed`, `WaitingListJoined` or `CustomerSegmentChanged`). A directly-invoked Profile or Customer transition SHALL record a **root** event (no `causation_id`; `correlation_id` defaults to its own `event_id`); a `ProfileSuspended`/`ProfileReactivated` recorded **inside** the `SuspendCustomer`/`ReactivateCustomer` cascade SHALL be a **causation child** of the parent `CustomerSuspended`/`CustomerReactivated` (its `causation_id` and `correlation_id` set to the parent), so the cascade is one honest causal chain.

#### Scenario: Each status transition records its verbatim event PII-free

- **WHEN** any of the eight evented transitions runs
- **THEN** exactly its corresponding event is recorded in the writing transaction, tagged module `parties`, with the entity type/id and an `actor_role` from `ActorContext`, and its payload contains only entity ids and enum/business values (no name, email, phone or date of birth)

#### Scenario: Cancellation and Account transitions are audit-only; nothing outside the set fires

- **WHEN** `CancelProfile`, `SuspendAccount`, `ReactivateAccount` or `CloseAccount` runs
- **THEN** no domain event is recorded for that transition, and across the whole change no event name outside `{CustomerSuspended, CustomerReactivated, CustomerClosed, ProfileSuspended, ProfileReactivated, ProfileExpired, ProfileRenewed, ProfileInactive}` is recorded

#### Scenario: A cascaded Profile event is a causation child of the Customer event

- **WHEN** `SuspendCustomer` cascades `ProfileSuspended` to a Profile
- **THEN** that `ProfileSuspended` carries `causation_id` and `correlation_id` referencing the same-transaction `CustomerSuspended` root event

### Requirement: Club Credit Entity and One-Active-Per-Profile Invariant

The system SHALL persist **Club Credit** as a Module K entity (`parties_club_credits`) — a per-Profile **prepayment instrument**, entirely distinct from the Voucher. Each Club Credit SHALL reference exactly one **Profile** (a within-module reference) and SHALL carry: an `amount` and a `remaining` balance, each an integer count of minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code (a `Money`, never a float — invariant 6); a validity window (`valid_from`, `valid_to`); and a `state` ∈ {`active`, `redeemed`, `forfeited`}. The FSM SHALL be `active → redeemed | forfeited`: a Club Credit is created `active`; `redeemed` and `forfeited` are reached only through the writer Actions; and `redeemed → active` is reachable only via `RestoreClubCredit` (a downstream order-cancellation effect, not a Club Credit primitive). The `amount` and `remaining` currencies SHALL be equal and SHALL be **immutable** across the credit's lifetime (set once at issuance).

At most **one `active` Club Credit per Profile** SHALL exist at any moment. This invariant SHALL be enforced **structurally** by a partial unique index on `(profile_id)` scoped to `state = 'active'` — so a `redeemed` or `forfeited` credit frees the slot and the next issuance inserts cleanly, while a second concurrent `active` insert for the same Profile is rejected at the database level.

#### Scenario: A Club Credit carries amount, remaining, validity and an FSM state

- **WHEN** a Club Credit is created
- **THEN** it references exactly one Profile, carries `amount` and `remaining` as `Money` (integer minor units + ISO 4217 currency), a `valid_from`/`valid_to` window, and `state = active`, with `amount` and `remaining` sharing one immutable currency

#### Scenario: At most one active Club Credit per Profile (structural)

- **GIVEN** a Profile that already holds an `active` Club Credit
- **WHEN** a second `active` Club Credit is inserted for that Profile
- **THEN** the partial unique index rejects it (the one-active invariant holds at the database level)

#### Scenario: A terminal credit frees the slot

- **GIVEN** a Profile whose only Club Credit is `redeemed` or `forfeited`

### Requirement: Club Credit Issuance

A Club Credit SHALL be issued by an explicit within-module `IssueClubCredit` Action — the sole creator of a Club Credit row — running inside one `DB::transaction`. Issuance SHALL be gated on the Profile's Club having `generates_credit = true`; an issuance for a Profile whose Club has `generates_credit = false` SHALL be rejected with a localized exception and create no row. The issued credit's `amount` SHALL equal the Club's `fee` **verbatim** (both minor units and currency) — at launch the welcome-window proportional scaling (K.18) is deferred, so **full fee → full credit**; `remaining` SHALL be initialized equal to `amount`; `valid_from` SHALL be the issuance moment and `valid_to` SHALL default to **31 December of the issuance year**; and the credit SHALL be created in `state = active`. A Club with `generates_credit = true` but **no `fee`** cannot define an amount; such an issuance SHALL be rejected (no zero/undefined credit).

In production the issuance trigger is Module E's `MembershipFeePaid` event, gated on payment-provider-confirmed payment success (§11.1); Module E does not exist, so the **`MembershipFeePaid` listener is a deferred Module-E seam** — `IssueClubCredit` is the within-module writer, invoked by the operator/seam path now and directly in tests, and **no** Module-E event contract is fabricated. Issuance SHALL NOT be blocked by Holds (the entitlement is recorded once the fee is paid — only redemption is Hold-gated, §11.2). The operator manual-issuance path (K.19) SHALL NOT be built at launch (launch goodwill routes through the Module S `REFUND_COMPENSATION` coupon); the `IssueClubCredit` writer is itself the retained K.19 seam.

#### Scenario: Issue a full-fee credit on a credit-generating Club

- **GIVEN** a Profile whose Club has `generates_credit = true` and a non-null `fee`, and no `active` Club Credit
- **WHEN** `IssueClubCredit` is invoked for that Profile
- **THEN** a Club Credit is created `active` with `amount` equal to the Club's `fee` (minor units + currency), `remaining` equal to `amount`, `valid_from` the issuance moment and `valid_to` 31 December of the issuance year

#### Scenario: Issuance is refused when the Club does not generate credit

- **WHEN** `IssueClubCredit` is invoked for a Profile whose Club has `generates_credit = false`
- **THEN** the issuance is rejected and no Club Credit row is created

#### Scenario: Issuance is refused when the Club has no fee

- **WHEN** `IssueClubCredit` is invoked for a Profile whose Club has `generates_credit = true` but `fee` is null
- **THEN** the issuance is rejected (no amount can be defined) and no Club Credit row is created

#### Scenario: The fee-paid trigger is a deferred Module-E seam

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** `IssueClubCredit` exists as the within-module writer of issuance, and there is **no** `MembershipFeePaid` listener and no fabricated Module-E event class in this change

### Requirement: Club Credit Redemption and Carry-Forward

A Club Credit SHALL be redeemed by an explicit within-module `ApplyClubCredit` Action — the sole writer of `remaining` and of the `active → redeemed` transition — running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read. Given a redeemed amount (a `Money`), the Action SHALL, before any write: reject unless the credit is `active`; reject unless the redeemed amount's currency equals the credit currency; and reject unless the redeemed amount does not exceed `remaining` (no negative balance — a package exceeding the credit applies the full `remaining` and the difference is paid in cash, a Module S concern). It SHALL then set `remaining = remaining − redeemed`: if the new `remaining` is **zero**, the credit SHALL transition to `redeemed`; if the new `remaining` is **positive**, the credit SHALL stay `active` and the balance **carries forward** for future purchases (**K.17**).

Redemption SHALL be **frozen while the owning Profile is suspended**: `ApplyClubCredit` SHALL reject when the Profile's `state = Suspended` (no redemption during suspension — AC-K-FSM-2a; the credit becomes mutable again once the Profile is restored). The data Module K exposes for eligibility is the credit's `active` state, its `remaining`, its currency, and its issuing Club (via `profile.club_id`); the **checkout decision** — Offer matching (`credit.profile.club_id ∈ offer.club_ids`), currency-match at price resolution, the coupon **mutual-exclusion** (one coupon XOR one Club Credit per checkout), auto-apply, and the Hold-gated price resolution — is a **Module S** concern and SHALL NOT be built in this change.

#### Scenario: Partial redemption carries the balance forward (K.17)

- **GIVEN** an `active` Club Credit with `remaining` of 25000 minor units (EUR)
- **WHEN** `ApplyClubCredit` redeems 9000 minor units (EUR)
- **THEN** `remaining` becomes 16000 minor units and the credit stays `active` (the balance carries forward to future purchases)

#### Scenario: Full redemption transitions to redeemed

- **GIVEN** an `active` Club Credit with `remaining` of 16000 minor units (EUR)
- **WHEN** `ApplyClubCredit` redeems 16000 minor units (EUR)
- **THEN** `remaining` becomes zero and the credit transitions to `redeemed`

#### Scenario: Over-application and currency mismatch are rejected

- **WHEN** `ApplyClubCredit` redeems more than `remaining`, or redeems an amount whose currency differs from the credit currency
- **THEN** the Action is rejected with a localized exception and the credit's `remaining` and `state` are unchanged

#### Scenario: Redemption is frozen while the Profile is suspended

- **GIVEN** an `active` Club Credit whose owning Profile is `Suspended`
- **WHEN** `ApplyClubCredit` is invoked
- **THEN** it is rejected (the credit is frozen during suspension); after the Profile is restored to `Active`, the same redemption succeeds

### Requirement: Club Credit Forfeiture and Restoration

A Club Credit SHALL be forfeited by an explicit within-module `ForfeitClubCredit` Action — the sole writer of the `active → forfeited` transition — running inside one `DB::transaction` against a transaction-locked re-read; it SHALL reject unless the credit is `active`, and `forfeited` SHALL be **terminal** (at most one forfeiture per credit lifetime). A Club Credit SHALL be restored by an explicit within-module `RestoreClubCredit` Action — the sole writer of the `redeemed → active` transition — which SHALL reject unless the credit is `redeemed` **and** the Profile holds no other `active` Club Credit (the one-active invariant is respected, not violated).

The **forfeiture triggers** (§11.3) are documented cross-module / scheduler seams **not** wired by this change: year-end lapse past `valid_to` (a **scheduler** seam — mirrors the `LapseProfile` validity-period seam); renewal-triggered replacement (**forfeit-before-issue**, sequenced within the Module-E renewal-time `MembershipFeePaid` consumption); Profile cancellation (a within-module follow-on cascade); and Club closure, on which the residual balance is converted to Discovery store credit at face value with 12-month validity (**DEC-043**) — an operation **owned by Module S**, with Module K's role ending at the upstream cancellation/closure signal (**AC-K-XM-23**). The **forfeit-before-issue ordering** is nonetheless exercised at launch: because the one-active invariant makes `IssueClubCredit` reject when an `active` credit exists, re-issuance requires `ForfeitClubCredit` then `IssueClubCredit`. The **order-cancellation-window** trigger for `RestoreClubCredit` is likewise a Module-S seam; the writer ships and is tested directly.

#### Scenario: Forfeit an active credit (terminal)

- **WHEN** `ForfeitClubCredit` is invoked on an `active` credit
- **THEN** its `state` becomes `forfeited`; any subsequent forfeiture, apply or restore on it is rejected (terminal)

#### Scenario: Forfeit-before-issue ordering holds via the one-active invariant

- **GIVEN** a Profile with an `active` Club Credit
- **WHEN** `IssueClubCredit` is invoked again for that Profile
- **THEN** it is rejected (one-active); and after `ForfeitClubCredit` forfeits the existing credit, `IssueClubCredit` then succeeds — the forfeit-before-issue ordering the renewal listener will perform

#### Scenario: Restore a redeemed credit, one-active-respecting

- **GIVEN** a `redeemed` Club Credit whose Profile holds no other `active` credit
- **WHEN** `RestoreClubCredit` is invoked
- **THEN** the credit returns to `active` with its `remaining` restored
- **WHEN** instead the Profile already holds another `active` credit
- **THEN** `RestoreClubCredit` is rejected (the one-active invariant is preserved)

#### Scenario: Club-closure conversion is not owned by Module K

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** there is **no** Club-Credit-to-store-credit conversion logic in Module K (the DEC-043 conversion is a Module S concern); Module K ships only the `ForfeitClubCredit` writer and ends at the upstream signal

### Requirement: Club Credit State Recording Is Module-E-Owned

Module K SHALL NOT emit any Club Credit lifecycle domain event. The events `ClubCreditIssued`, `ClubCreditApplied`, `ClubCreditRestored` and `ClubCreditForfeited` — and the upstream `MembershipFeePaid` — are **Module E's** events (§11.4 / §15.8); Module K consumes them and records the resulting state on its own Club Credit entity. Because Module E does not exist (Phase 6), this change SHALL build the within-module writer Actions as **audit-only** state writers — they `update()` the credit `state`/`remaining` and record **no** domain event — and SHALL fabricate **no** `MembershipFeePaid` or `ClubCredit*` event class. This mirrors the audit-only-write precedent (a KYC transition records `kyc_status` with no KYC event; the Account family writes `status` with no event). When Module E lands, its `MembershipFeePaid` listener and its `ClubCredit*` consumers SHALL invoke these same within-module writers; the entity-state authority (Module K) and the financial-event authority (Module E) compose without rework.

#### Scenario: No Club Credit domain event is emitted by Module K

- **WHEN** any Club Credit writer (`IssueClubCredit` / `ApplyClubCredit` / `ForfeitClubCredit` / `RestoreClubCredit`) runs
- **THEN** the credit's state is updated and **no** `domain_events` row named `ClubCreditIssued` / `ClubCreditApplied` / `ClubCreditRestored` / `ClubCreditForfeited` (or `MembershipFeePaid`) is recorded by Module K

#### Scenario: No Module-E event class is fabricated

- **WHEN** the Parties code surface is inspected
- **THEN** no `MembershipFeePaid`, `ClubCreditIssued`, `ClubCreditApplied`, `ClubCreditRestored` or `ClubCreditForfeited` event class exists under `app/Modules/Parties` (the §11.4 ownership boundary; the invent-no-event discipline)
