/**
 * The independence + scope-guard proof for the compliance slice (parties-compliance task 6.1, design L1/L3;
 * party-registry — Requirements: Customer KYC Lifecycle, Customer Sanctions Screening Lifecycle, and the MODIFIED
 * "Birth States Recorded, Lifecycle Transitions Deferred"). Where {@see CustomerKycLifecycleTest} and
 * {@see CustomerSanctionsLifecycleTest} each pin ONE FSM in isolation, this one asserts the emergent contract of
 * the slice as a whole — that the three Customer state machines are mutually independent, and that the slice's
 * scope boundary holds:
 *   - the KYC FSM, the sanctions FSM and the Customer STATUS FSM are SEPARATE and INDEPENDENT (§ 9.1/§ 9.2/§ 9.4):
 *     the (kyc × sanctions) state-pair grid persists orthogonally with the Customer status pinned to its `pending`
 *     birth, and — driven through the REAL Actions — a KYC transition moves only `kyc_status` while a sanctions
 *     screening moves only `sanctions_status`, neither touching the other FSM nor the Customer status;
 *   - KYC itself is event-silent (design L3 — the PRD § 15.1 names no KYC event), but opening/clearing Customer KYC
 *     now AUTO-PLACES then AUTO-LIFTS the coupled `kyc` Hold (parties-holds), so the compliance flow records the two
 *     Hold events plus the sanctions completion — and no event NAME contains "Kyc";
 *   - the scope guard: reflecting the Parties `Actions/` namespace, the compliance + supply-side transition Actions
 *     exist but NO demand-side STATUS transition class does (no `ActivateCustomer` / `SuspendAccount` /
 *     `ApproveProfile` / `LockOriginatingClub`), `originating_club_id` has no setter (CreateCustomer's surface is
 *     exactly creation, and it is the only Action that writes the column — only NULL, at birth), the coupled `kyc`
 *     Hold place/lift performs NO Customer STATUS transition (the Hold→`suspended` coupling is deferred), and no
 *     demand-side status event (`CustomerActivated` / `ProfileActivated` / `OriginatingClubLocked` /
 *     `CustomerSegmentChanged`) is recorded.
 *
 * The EXACT-SET "only these non-Create Actions exist" whitelist has a single canonical home in
 * {@see SupplyLifecycleChainTest}; this file is its independence-angle companion and uses a forbidden-name negative
 * check (robust to future legitimate compliance Actions), so a new compliance Action need not be declared in two
 * places. SpineCreationChainTest and the architecture tests (ModuleBoundariesTest, ModulePersistenceConventionsTest)
 * stay GREEN UNAMENDED — every reference here is within Module K and this change adds no model. RefreshDatabase per
 * the directory convention; each Action opens its OWN transaction (the recorder's `transactionLevel() === 0` guard
 * is satisfied by the savepoint under the wrapper). Events are asserted BY NAME and entity types by value — never a
 * byte-compare of stored jsonb (PG reorders keys — knowledge/testing trap 3) — so the file holds on PostgreSQL 17.
